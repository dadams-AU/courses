## Introduction

-   We seek to understand and find solutions for public problems.

-   We have many theories about how the policy process works.

    -   Many are *interdisciplinary*.
:::

::: section
-   We will focus on the *politics* of policy.
    -   How do we get from a problem to a solution?
    -   How do we get from a solution to a policy?
    -   How do we get from a policy to a program?
    -   How do we get from a program to an outcome?
:::

::: section
Across the political landscape, we have many different views about what
things are problems, what are the solutions to those problems, whether a
government program is the best way to solve those problems, and what are
the best ways to implement solutions.

## Politics and the Policy Process

-   **Politics** is the process of making collective decisions, usually
    by governments, to allocate public resources and to create and
    enforce rules for the operation of society.

-   **Politics** is how we organize and govern ourselves; the art and
    science of government.
:::

::: section
-   **Public Policy** is the course of action the government takes in
    response to an issue or problem.

-   Public policy is political because it takes place in the *public
    sphere*.

-   Public policy addresses problems that are public or problems that
    some members of society think *should* be public.

# What is Public?
:::

::: section
-   Public versus Private come to us from the Latin *publicus* and
    *privatus*, from Ancient Rome

-   Publicus means "of the people" or "of the state"

-   Privatus means "individual" or "personal"
:::

::: section
## What is Public?

  -------------------- -----------------------------------
  Public (publicus)    Private (privatus)
  Polis -- the State   The Household -- private business
  Freedom              Necessity
  Equality             Inequality
  Immortality          Mortality
  Open                 Closed
  -------------------- -----------------------------------

These distinctions begin to collapse from the 19th century onward.

## Political Theory, Quickly

Political theory is the study of the ideas and values that underpin
political systems and institutions.

We\'ll look at Western Political Theory in brief:
:::

::: section
## Early Concepts: Gilgamesh (2500-ish BCE)

-   One of the earliest written records of governance.
-   Introduces the concept of two classes: rulers and subjects.
-   Sets the stage for Western ideas about hierarchy and authority.
:::

::: section
## The Greeks: Foundations of Political Philosophy (6th-3rd Century BCE)

-   **Socrates:** Ethics and justice in governance.
-   **Plato:** The \"ideal state\" ruled by philosopher-kings.
-   **Aristotle:** Empirical approach to politics; governments must
    promote virtue and balance.
:::

::: section
## 15th-17th Century Thinkers

-   **Machiavelli:** Politics as power; pragmatism over idealism.
-   **Bacon:** Knowledge as power; science and governance intertwined.
:::

::: section
## The Enlightenment (17th-18th Centuries)

-   **Hobbes:** Social contract; strong authority prevents chaos.
-   **Locke:** Rights to life, liberty, and property; government must
    protect individual freedoms.
-   **Rousseau:** General will; collective good over individual
    interests.
-   **Montesquieu:** Separation of powers to avoid tyranny.
:::

::: section
## The American Regime

-   **Founding Fathers:** Jefferson, Madison, and Hamilton synthesized
    Enlightenment ideals for the U.S. context.
-   Key principles: liberty, equality, and a government of the people.
-   Continuing influence: Lincoln, Roosevelt(s), King, and others,
    interpreting liberalism in different eras.
:::

::: section
## 20th Century Theorists

-   **Rawls:** Justice as fairness; prioritizing the least advantaged.
-   **Marx and Weber:** Economic forces and power dynamics shape
    society.
-   **Dewey:** Pragmatism and the role of public engagement in policy.
-   **Lasswell:** \"Who gets what, when, and how\"---the essence of
    politics.
:::

::: section
## The Evolution of Liberalism

Liberalism evolves as a response to changing societal needs and economic
conditions:

-   **Classical Liberalism:** Rooted in the Enlightenment, emphasizing
    individual freedoms, limited government, and free markets.
-   **Reform Liberalism:** Emerges in response to industrialization;
    advocates for government intervention to address inequality and
    promote welfare.
-   **Neoliberalism:** Reacts to perceived inefficiencies of the welfare
    state; prioritizes market solutions with reduced government roles.

This progression reflects ongoing debates about liberty, equality, and
the proper role of the state.
:::

::: section
## Why Political Theory and Public Policy?

-   Political theory provides a foundation for understanding governance
    and policy.
-   Public policy applies theory to real-world problems and solutions.
-   Together, they inform how we think about and address public issues.
-   Reveal fundamental beliefs about the role of the state that frame
    nearly all public policy debates.
:::
::::::::::::

::: section
## Policy for the Common Good

Policy is a tool governments use to address public problems and improve
society. It reflects collective decisions about priorities and values.

-   **Policy as Meaning-Making:** Defines how society understands and
    prioritizes public issues.
-   **Policy as Action:** A deliberate statement by government outlining
    what it will do---or choose not to do---about a specific problem.
-   **Policy as Value Delivery:** Determines how goods, services, and
    opportunities are distributed and regulated.
:::

::: section
## Policy Reveals Values

> "Policies are revealed through texts, practices, symbols, and
> discourses that define and deliver values including goods and services
> as well as regulations, incomes, status, and other positively or
> negatively valued attributes."
>
> \- Deborah Stone
:::

::: section
## Change: The Basic Tension in Policy

-   **How does policy change happen?**
    -   Through manipulation of existing norms?
    -   Through building relationships and coalitions?
-   **How does social learning occur?**
    -   By adapting to new evidence or ideas?
    -   By responding to societal needs?
-   **What happens when change occurs outside government?**
    -   Grassroots movements
    -   Non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
:::

::: section
## Key Elements of Effective Policy

### Participation, Observation, and Capacity Building

-   **Participation:**
    -   Who participates in the policy process?
    -   Who is excluded?
    -   How can participation become more meaningful?
-   **Observation:**
    -   How do we know what is happening?
    -   How do we evaluate what works and what doesn't?
    -   How do we identify problems effectively?
-   **Capacity Building:**
    -   How do we empower individuals and communities to engage?
    -   How do we enhance the ability to implement solutions?
:::

## The Common Will

Policy is an attempt to translate the popular will into a political
reality.

-   In a liberal democracy, the popular will is expressed through
    elections; it is derived from the people.
-   When advocates convince the government to make a policy, one can
    claim the government does so in the *public interest*.
:::

::: section
## The Public Interest

### The assumed broader desires and needs of the public, in whose name policy is made.

-   The public interest is a contested concept.
-   The public interest is a political concept.
-   The public interest is a moral concept.

\
\

### Hard to define: {#hard-to-define .fragment}

-   Who gets to define it?
-   Advocates claim *their* preferences are in the public interest.
-   When something goes wrong, we claim the government is not acting in
    the public interest.
-   It changes over time.
