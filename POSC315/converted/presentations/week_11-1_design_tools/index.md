# Policy Design and Tools

## POSC 315 \| Week 11

::: divider
:::

Understanding how policies are crafted to address public problems
::::

::::: {.section transition="fade"}
## Policy Design

::: box
The process by which policies are designed---through technical analysis
and political negotiation---to achieve a public goal.
:::

-   Occurs across the policy process, not just at the beginning
-   Involves selecting policy tools to pursue goals
-   Balances *technical feasibility* with *political acceptability*

::: {.key-points .fragment .fade-up}
#### Key Insight:

Every design choice involves trade-offs---between values, goals, and
outcomes
:::
:::::

:::::: {.section transition="fade"}
## Policy Design and Implementation

::::: two-column
::: {.column .box}
### Design Influences Implementation

-   Shapes available resources
-   Establishes timelines and milestones
-   Determines which agencies are involved
-   Sets parameters for discretion
:::

::: {.column .accent-box}
### Implementation Informs Design

-   Experience can change the design
-   Implementation reveals unforeseen obstacles
-   Feedback loops may alter understanding of the problem
-   Administrative agencies interpret vague legislative commands
:::
:::::

The relationship between design and implementation is
[iterative]{.emphasis}, not linear
::::::

:::: {.section transition="convex"}
## Five Elements of Policy Design

1.  **Goals** - What is the policy trying to achieve?
2.  **Causal Theory** - What is the theory of change?
3.  **Tools** - What tools will be used to achieve the goals?
4.  **Target Population** - Who is the policy trying to affect?
5.  **Implementation** - How will the policy be implemented?

::: {.focus-box .fragment .fade-up}
These five elements must work together coherently for a policy to
succeed
:::
::::

::::::: {.section transition="convex"}
## Goals

::: box
The desired outcomes of the policy - what the policy is trying to
achieve
:::

::::: two-column
::: column
### Explicit Goals

-   Stated clearly in the policy text
-   Found in legislative history
-   Articulated in public statements
-   Measurable objectives and targets
:::

::: column
### Implicit Goals

-   Embedded in policy design choices
-   Revealed through implementation priorities
-   Sometimes political or symbolic
-   May reflect unstated priorities
:::
:::::

Multiple, sometimes [conflicting goals]{.emphasis} often exist within
the same policy
:::::::

::::: {.section transition="convex"}
## Causal Theory

::: box
The theory about what causes a problem and how the policy will address
it
:::

-   Forms the foundation of policy logic - the [theory of
    change]{.emphasis}
-   Essential for measuring the policy\'s success
-   Shapes selection of appropriate policy tools
-   Informs implementation strategies
-   Poor theory can lead to policy failure even with perfect
    implementation

::: {.accent-box .fragment .fade-up}
If your causal theory is wrong, even the most well-implemented policy
will fail to achieve its goals
:::
:::::

:::: {.section transition="convex"}
## Causal Theory:

### Problem Definition → Policy Design

::: box
Problems are socially constructed and defined - they don\'t simply exist
\"out there\"
:::

-   Different stakeholders frame problems differently
-   Each problem definition implies a different solution
-   Whoever successfully defines the problem gains advantage in
    designing the solution
-   Problems must be defined as something we can do something about
::::

::::::: {.section transition="convex"}
## Problem Definition Example

::::: two-column
::: {.column .box}
#### Example: Homelessness

Defined as:

-   Housing affordability crisis
-   Mental health/addiction issue
-   Economic displacement
:::

::: {.column .accent-box}
#### Resulting Policy Approaches:

-   Affordable housing development
-   Treatment and services
-   Job programs and economic support
:::
:::::

::: key-points
The way we define the problem shapes the solutions we consider

## Policy Goals

### from Deborah Stone\'s *Policy Paradox*

::: box
-   **Security** - Protecting people from harm
-   **Liberty** - Protecting people\'s rights
-   **Efficiency** - Getting the most out of resources
-   **Equity** - Fairness in the distribution of resources
:::

::: {.key-points .fragment .fade-up}
Stone argues these goals are inherently in tension with one another -
policy design involves making trade-offs between them
:::

Making

::::::

:::::: section
## Equality: A Contested Goal

::::: two-column
::: {.column .box}
### Equality of Opportunity

-   Dominant in American political discourse
-   Everyone starts with same rules and chances
-   Policy focuses on removing barriers to entry
-   Minimal intervention in markets
-   Examples: Anti-discrimination laws, public education
:::

::: {.column .accent-box}
### Equality of Outcome

-   More prevalent in social democracies
-   Focuses on end distribution of resources
-   Policy aims to narrow gaps between groups
-   More significant market interventions
-   Examples: Progressive taxation, universal benefits
:::
:::::

Trade-offs involve balancing individual liberty with collective welfare,
and efficiency with equity
::::::

::::::: section
## Efficiency: A Contested Goal

::::: two-column
::: {.column .box}
### Core Concept

-   Often defined as achieving the most output for the least input
-   Usually a means to a goal, not an end in itself
-   The idea is to achieve an objective with the least amount of
    resources
-   Often in conflict with other goals like equity or comprehensiveness
:::

::: {.column .accent-box}
### Key Questions

-   How do we define and measure inputs?
-   How do we define and measure outputs?
-   Efficiency for whom? (Government, citizens, specific groups?)
-   What timeframe are we considering? (Short vs. long-term)
:::
:::::

::: {.key-points .fragment .fade-up}
Efficiency is not neutral or objective - it depends on how we value
different inputs and outputs
:::
:::::::

:::::: section
## Efficiency: A Contested Goal

Problems of efficiency:

::::: two-column
::: {.column .box}
### Measurement Challenges

-   What are the inputs and outputs?
-   How do we measure them accurately?
-   What is the appropriate time frame?
-   What is the opportunity cost?
:::

::: {.column .accent-box}
### Policy Examples

-   **Education:** Cost per student vs. quality metrics
-   **Healthcare:** Treatment speed vs. health outcomes
-   **Welfare:** Administrative costs vs. benefits delivered
-   **Infrastructure:** Quick fixes vs. sustainable solutions
:::

## Efficiency: A Contested Goal

> A good public library is not one that owns all the books that have
> ever been published, but one that has used its limited funds to build
> up as good a collection as possible under the circumstances

\- Herbert Simon

::: {.key-points .fragment .fade-up}
Efficiency is about making the best possible use of limited resources,
not maximizing every possible outcome
:::

::: citation
Herbert Simon, Administrative Behavior (1947)
:::
:::::

::::: section
## Efficiency: A Contested Goal

> People who oppose certain programs will often do so because they
> disagree with the substance of the policy. But it is much easier---and
> often more successful---to claim or expose how a policy is wasteful,
> rather than arguing about the policy\'s merits because nobody favors
> waste.

\- Deborah Stone

::: {.accent-box .fragment .fade-up}
Efficiency arguments can be strategic and political, not just technical
:::

::: citation
Stone, D. (2012). Policy Paradox: The Art of Political Decision Making
:::
:::::

::::::: section
## Equity: A Contested Goal

::: box
Equity is fairness in the distribution of resources, opportunities, and
outcomes
:::

-   Often in tension with efficiency and sometimes with liberty
-   Different conceptions of what counts as \"fair\"
-   Contested views on whether process or outcomes matter more
-   Disagreement about which inequities require intervention

::::: two-column
::: {.column .box}
### Forms of Equity

-   Horizontal equity (treating similar cases similarly)
-   Vertical equity (treating different cases differently)
-   Intergenerational equity
-   Procedural vs. substantive equity
:::

::: {.column .accent-box}
### Policy Approaches

-   Universal programs
-   Targeted interventions
-   Redistributive policies
-   Procedural safeguards
:::
:::::
:::::::

::::::: {.section .compact}
## Security vs. Liberty: Conflicting Goals

::::: two-column
::: {.column .box}
### Thomas Hobbes\' tradeoff:

-   Give up some liberties to the state, which holds the most power, so
    there is security
-   This is an authoritarian view of the state
-   Emphasizes security as prerequisite for all other rights
-   Views human nature as requiring strong control
:::

::: {.column .accent-box}
### John Locke\'s approach:

-   Form a social contract wherein one surrenders some liberties to
    create a government of limited power
-   Democratic view of the state
-   Sees liberty as fundamental natural right
-   Government exists primarily to protect rights
:::
:::::

::: {.key-points .fragment .fade-up}
These competing philosophical traditions continue to shape contemporary
policy debates
:::
:::::::

:::: section
## Security vs. Liberty: Modern Applications

This fundamental tension plays out in numerous policy areas:

-   **National Security:** Surveillance vs. privacy rights
-   **Public Health:** Mandatory measures vs. individual choice
-   **Gun Control:** Public safety vs. individual rights to bear arms
-   **Internet Regulation:** Protection from harm vs. free speech

::: {.box .fragment .fade-up}
The design question is not *whether* to limit liberty for security, but
*how much* and *in what ways* to balance these competing goods
:::
::::

::::: section
## Ambiguity and Goal Conflict

::: box
Policy design reveals that goals are often ambiguous and in conflict
with one another
:::

-   Different stakeholders prioritize different goals
-   Policy design reveals conflicts over means of achieving goals
-   Different policy goals can be in conflict with one another
    -   For example: Immigration policy versus foreign relations policy
        with Mexico

::: accent-box
Conflicts are not hopeless! They are *complex*. Good policy finds a
balance.

Policy ambiguity can sometimes be *strategic* - allowing coalitions to
form around different interpretations
:::
:::::

:::::: {.section .compact}
## Goal Conflicts - Real World Examples

### Environmental Policy

::: box
-   Environmental protection vs. economic growth
-   Carbon reduction vs. energy affordability
-   Conservation vs. resource development
-   Local impacts vs. global benefits
:::

### Healthcare Policy

::: accent-box
-   Universal access vs. cost containment
-   Quality of care vs. efficiency
-   Patient choice vs. standardized treatments
-   Prevention vs. treatment funding
:::

::: key-points
The most effective policies don\'t eliminate conflicts - they manage
them transparently
:::
::::::

::::::: section
## Balancing Competing Goals

::::: two-column
::: {.column .box}
### Common Trade-offs

-   **Efficiency vs. Equity:** Cost-effectiveness vs. fair distribution
-   **Security vs. Liberty:** Protection vs. freedom
-   **Speed vs. Deliberation:** Quick action vs. careful planning
-   **Standardization vs. Flexibility:** Consistency vs. adaptability
:::

::: {.column .accent-box}
### Balancing Strategies

-   Prioritization - which goal takes precedence?
-   Compromise - finding middle ground
-   Sequencing - different goals at different stages
-   Compensation - offsetting negative impacts
-   Mixed strategies - different approaches for different segments
:::
:::::

::: {.fragment .fade-up .focus-box}
Policy design is not about eliminating all tensions, but making
thoughtful choices about trade-offs
:::
:::::::

:::::: {.section .super-compact}
## Case Study: Balancing Competing Goals

### Healthcare Policy Example

::::: two-column
::: {.column .box}
#### Competing Goals

-   **Universal Access:** Everyone gets healthcare
-   **Quality:** High standards of care
-   **Cost Control:** Affordable for society
-   **Provider Autonomy:** Medical judgment
-   **Patient Choice:** Selection of providers/treatments
:::

::: {.column .accent-box}
#### Balancing Approaches

-   **Tiered Systems:** Basic universal coverage with optional
    supplements
-   **Quality Metrics:** Performance-based payments
-   **Managed Care:** Coordinated services with oversight
-   **Public-Private Mix:** Different sectors handle different aspects
:::
:::::

Policy designers must explicitly address these tensions rather than
ignoring them
::::::

:::: {.section .compact}
## Complexity and Differing Goals

Is the purpose of the goal to eliminate a problem, hold steady a growing
problem, or reduce the problem to a lower level?

::: box
### War on Drugs Example

-   **Elimination:** Zero tolerance, maximum enforcement, severe
    penalties
-   **Holding Steady:** Targeted enforcement, education campaigns
-   **Reduction:** Harm reduction strategies, treatment over punishment
:::

Each approach implies different tools, resources, timeframes, and
metrics for success
::::

:::::: {.section .compact}
## Scalability of Policy Goals

::::: two-column
::: {.column .box}
### Goal Intensity Questions

-   How much change is needed?
-   What is politically feasible?
-   What is administratively possible?
-   What resources are available?
-   What is the timeframe?
:::

::: {.column .accent-box}
### Target Setting Example

-   Ambitious: Carbon neutrality by 2030
-   Moderate: 50% emissions reduction by 2035
-   Minimal: Stabilize emissions by 2040
-   Each target demands different policy tools
:::
:::::

Policy designers must balance ambition with feasibility when setting
targets
::::::

::::::: section
## Policy Design Framework

::::: two-column
::: {.column .box}
#### Core Elements

-   **Goals:** What the policy is trying to achieve
-   **Causal Theory:** Why the proposed solution will work
-   **Tools:** The instruments used to achieve goals
-   **Implementation:** How the policy is carried out
:::

::: {.column .accent-box}
#### Cross-Cutting Themes

-   **Equity:** Who benefits or bears costs?
-   **Efficiency:** Are we using resources well?
-   **Political Feasibility:** Can it gain support?
-   **Administrative Capacity:** Can it be implemented?
:::
:::::

::: key-points
Design is the intersection of logic, values, and institutional capacity
:::
:::::::

::::: {.section transition="zoom"}
## Policy Tools

::: box
The means by which the policy will achieve its goals
:::

-   How government seeks a policy objective
-   The interface between the government\'s intentions and actual
    implementation outcomes
-   Range from direct provision to market incentives to regulations

::: {.accent-box .fragment .fade-up}
The selection of appropriate policy tools is crucial for successful
implementation
:::
:::::

::::::: section
## Policy Tool Typology

#### Schneider & Ingram (1990)

::::: two-column
::: {.column .box}
-   **Authority tools:** Rules backed by sanctions (e.g., mandates)
-   **Incentive tools:** Rewards or penalties (e.g., taxes, subsidies)
:::

::: {.column .accent-box}
-   **Capacity tools:** Build ability to comply (e.g., training,
    funding)
-   **Symbolic tools:** Signal intent or values (e.g., proclamations)
:::
:::::

::: {.key-points .fragment .fade-up}
Most policies use a mix of tools, each reflecting assumptions about how
people behave
:::
:::::::

::::::: section
## Dimensions of Policy Tools

::::: two-column
::: {.column .box}
#### Type of Activity

-   Money (grants, payments)
-   Services, protections, restrictions

#### Delivery System

-   Direct (govt) vs. Indirect (nonprofits, contractors)
:::

::: {.column .accent-box}
#### Centralization

-   Federal, state, or shared

#### Complexity

-   Simple vs. layered or customized
:::
:::::

::: key-points
Effective tools match the problem's nature, target population, and
administrative context
:::
:::::::

:::::: {.section transition="concave"}
## Love, Fear, and Money (Etzioni 1961)

::: box
Three basic reasons why people comply with rules, orders, or policy:
:::

-   **Love:** Compliance out of a sense of agreement, love, or moral
    obligation
-   **Fear:** Compliance out of a sense of fear of punishment
-   **Money:** Compliance is in one\'s monetary or remunerative interest

::: {.key-points .fragment .fade-up}
Effective policies find a balance between low levels of fear and high
levels of love and money
:::

::: citation
Source: Etzioni, A. (1961). A Comparative Analysis of Complex
Organizations
:::
::::::

::::::: {.section transition="concave"}
## Love, Fear, and Money - Applications

::::: two-column
::: {.column .box}
### Policy Examples

-   **Love:** Public campaigns that appeal to moral duty (recycling,
    blood donation)
-   **Fear:** Traffic fines, criminal penalties, business regulations
-   **Money:** Tax incentives, subsidies, grants, economic benefits
:::

::: {.column .accent-box}
### Trade-offs

-   Fear-based tools are often immediately effective but create
    resistance
-   Love-based tools create sustainable behavior but take time to
    develop
-   Money-based tools work well but can be expensive and create
    dependency
:::
:::::

::: {.focus-box .fragment .fade-up}
Different policy domains may require different compliance mechanisms
:::
:::::::

:::: {.section transition="concave"}
## Balancing Compliance Mechanisms

Policy designers must consider:

-   Cultural context - what motivates the target population?
-   Time horizon - immediate compliance vs. long-term sustainability
-   Resource constraints - economic tools require budgets
-   Political feasibility - coercive tools face more resistance
-   Administrative capacity - can the implementing agency enforce?

::: accent-box
*The most effective policies typically employ a mix of all three
mechanisms tailored to context and goals*
:::
::::

::::::: section
## Policy Tool Considerations

::: box
-   Non-Coercive to coercive (love to fear) exist along a continuum
-   The extent to which government will use its resources to achieve a
    policy goal
-   Choosing effective tools requires a good causal theory
:::

::::: two-column
::: {.column .box}
### Questions to Ask

-   What behavior needs to change?
-   Who needs to take action?
-   What might motivate compliance?
-   What tools are politically feasible?
:::

::: {.column .accent-box}
### Tool Selection Criteria

-   Effectiveness
-   Efficiency
-   Equity
-   Enforceability
-   Political acceptability

## Models of Policy Tools

#### Howlett, Ramesh, and Perl

::: box
Policy tools represent the specific instruments governments use to
implement policies and achieve policy goals.

They range from direct service provision to market incentives to
regulations.
:::

::: key-points
The choice of tools reflects both technical considerations and political
values
:::

::: citation
Source: Howlett, M., Ramesh, M., & Perl, A. (2009). Studying Public
Policy: Policy Cycles and Policy Subsystems
:::
::::::

::::: section
## Economic Tools

::: box
### Characteristics

-   Favor individual freedom and choice
-   Tend to use non-coercive means
-   Makes many assumptions about what is \"possible\" and what is
    \"rational\"
-   Assumes that people are rational actors
:::

::: accent-box
### Examples

-   **Subsidies:** Agriculture, energy, housing
-   **Tax incentives:** R&D credits, mortgage deductions
-   **Vouchers:** Education, housing, healthcare
-   **User fees:** Parks, highways, utilities
-   **Market creation:** Cap and trade systems
:::
:::::

::::::: section
## Economic Tools: Trade-offs

::::: two-column
::: {.column .box}
### Advantages

-   Preserve individual choice and market mechanisms
-   Often more politically palatable than regulations
-   Can harness market efficiency for public goals
-   Allow flexible responses by target populations
:::

::: {.column .accent-box}
### Disadvantages

-   May not work when markets are imperfect
-   Can be captured by special interests
-   Benefits may be unequally distributed
-   Effectiveness depends on accurate pricing
-   May have unintended consequences
:::
:::::

::: key-points
Economic tools work best when markets function well and policy goals
align with individual self-interest
:::

::::::: {.section .compact}
## Political Tools

> \"Any instrument \[or tool\] can theoretically accomplish any chosen
> aim, but governments prefer less coercive instruments unless forced by
> either recalcitrance on the part of the subject and/or continued
> social pressure for change to utilize more coercive instruments.\"

[- Howlett, Ramesh, and Perl]{style="font-size:0.7em"}

::::: two-column
::: {.column .box}
### Political Tool Examples:

-   **Regulations:** Command-and-control rules
-   **Direct provision:** Government services
:::

::: {.column .accent-box}
-   **Information:** Public campaigns
-   **Public enterprises:** State-owned entities

## Tools and Choices

::::: two-column
::: {.column .box}
### Key Considerations

-   Technically sound design ≠ political viability
-   Resources constrain available options
-   Behavioral assumptions matter
-   Multiple tools typically needed
:::

::: {.column .accent-box}
### Tool Selection Factors

-   Administrative capacity
-   Organizational culture
-   Past policy experiences
-   Political support/opposition
-   Time constraints
:::
:::::

The most successful policies use complementary tools that address
different aspects of the problem
::::::

:::: section
## Objective and Subjective Tools

### Objective - Rational Characteristics

::: box
-   **Target population:** The citizens who receive the benefits or bear
    the costs of the policy
-   **Values:** What is being distributed or promoted
-   **Rules:** Guidelines governing or constraining action
-   **Rationales:** The justification for the policy
-   **Assumptions:** Behavioral theories that tie all of these together
:::

These represent the technical elements of policy design - the
\"mechanics\" of how policies function
::::

:::: section
## Objective and Subjective Tools

### Subjective - Value Characteristics

::: box
-   Who justifiably deserves the costs and benefits of the policy?
-   What values should be backed by the coercive powers of the state?
-   Who (or what) should have the freedom of action promoted or
    constrained to uphold those values?
:::

These represent the normative and political dimensions of policy design
::::

:::::: section
## Objective and Subjective Elements: Interplay

::::: two-column
::: {.column .box}
### Climate Policy Example

**Objective elements:**

-   Carbon pricing mechanisms
-   Emissions targets and timelines
-   Reporting requirements
-   Enforcement structures
:::

::: {.column .accent-box}
**Subjective elements:**

-   Intergenerational justice concerns
-   Distribution of transition costs
-   Rights of affected communities
-   Balance between global and local interests
:::
:::::

Effective policy design requires attention to both dimensions
::::::

:::: section
## Integrating Policy Design Elements

-   Goals must be clearly articulated but may require flexibility
-   Causal theories should be evidence-based but acknowledge
    uncertainties
-   Tools should match both the technical aspects of the problem and
    reflect societal values
-   Target populations must be precisely defined while considering
    equity implications
-   Implementation plans need to address both administrative capacity
    and political sustainability

## Apply the Framework

::: box
Use these design questions to strengthen your policy process paper:
:::

-   What are the policy\'s stated and unstated goals?
-   What is the causal logic? Why will this work?
-   What tool(s) are used, and why?
-   Who is the target population?
-   How is the policy implemented?
-   What trade-offs are present---between equity, efficiency, and
    feasibility?
