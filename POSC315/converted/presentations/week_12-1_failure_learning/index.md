## Implementation Review

-   Policy implementation is very complex

-   Policy isn't self-executing

-   Policy Design to improve implementation is challenging

-   Bureaucrats have discretion
:::

::: section
## Is Implementation Technical or Political?

#### The old idea:

-   administration simply does the will of the legislature (see Wilson
    \[1887, 1989\] and Goodnow \[1900\])

#### The new idea:

-   administration is a political process (see Appleby \[1949\] and
    Waldo \[1948\]) and so is implementation (see Pressman and Wildavsky
    \[1973\])
:::

::: section
## Who is Responsible for Implementation?

-   The legislature?
-   The executive?
-   The bureaucracy?
-   The courts?
-   The public?
-   All of the above?

## Implementation Studies: Four Generations

-   First Generation: The "Classics" (1930s-1950s)
-   Second Generation: The "Moderns" (1960s-1970s)
-   Third Generation: The "Post-Moderns" (1980s-1990s)
-   Fourth Generation: The "New New" (2000s)

## Policy Failure

### Why some policies might not work
:::

::: section
## Possible Reasons for Policy Failure

-   People may respond or adapt to public policies in a manner that
    negates some of their influence.

-   Policies may have incompatible goals that bring them into conflict
    with one another.

-   Solutions for some problems may involve costs and consequences
    greater than people are willing to accept.
:::

::: section
## Possible Reasons for Policy Failure

-   Inadequate resources may be allocated to implement a policy.

-   Policies may be administered to lessen their potential effect, i.e.,
    watered down upon implementation

-   Public problems are often caused by a multitude of factors, but the
    policy may be only directed at one or a few of them. Why?
:::

::: section
## Possible Reasons for Policy Failure

-   Many problems cannot be solved, or at least not completely

-   New problems may arise that distract attention from a problem

-   Many national problems and policies are implemented by state and
    local agencies and are sometimes designed at the local level
:::

::: section
## Responses to Policy Failure

-   Adjustments in enforcement

-   More money or resources

-   Challenge(s) to the legality or constitutionality of the policy

-   The policy or its program is simply ignored

-   The policy is left to local governments to implement or improve upon

-   The policy is abandoned or repealed

## Policy Failure

### A *Slippery* Concept
:::

::: section
## Two Types of Failure

1.  Theoretical Failure

    -   The causal theory didn't work as predicted

2.  Programmatic Failure

    -   Implementation didn't work as planned
:::

::: section
## Failure is in the eye of the beholder

-   When did it fail?

-   Who did it fail?

-   Where did it fail?

-   How did it fail?

## Failure is Challenging to Define

-   Some problems may be tentative first steps toward resolving a
    broader social problem.

-   Doing something may indicate the political system "responds to
    problem, even if knowledge may be limited and appropriate policy
    tools unavailable."

-   Would the "do nothing" option have been better?
:::

::: section
## Failure is Challenging to Define

###### Excessive Policy Demand

*Constant demands on the part of the gov't to do "something" may make
more failures more inevitable as more policy with more complexity fails
to meet expectations.*

*Gov't may fuel this demand by claiming to have the resources and tools
available to implement a policy that may be technically infeasible.*
:::

::: section
## Failure is Challenging to Define

### Reasonable Expectations

-   We may reach too far in expecting gov't can solve a problem

-   If we make progress, is that failure, even if we don't meet the
    exact goal?
:::

::: section
## Poor Causal Theory

Failure is often the product of a poor causal theory:

-   Theory influences tool choice

-   Choice of tools influences implementation

-   Implementation influences outcomes

## Learning from Failure
:::

::: section
## Policy Failure and Learning

-   learning can lead to policy change

-   learning is accumulating information for better decision making

-   learning is a process of discovery, and key to evaluation
:::

::: section
## Two Types of Learning

1.  **Single-loop learning** is a process of correcting errors in the
    implementation of a policy without questioning the policy itself.

-   learn about performance
-   learn how the process or tools may have failed
-   adjust by changing the process or tools
:::

::: section
## Two Types of Learning

2.  **Double-loop learning** is a process of questioning the policy
    itself and the assumptions that underlie it.

-   learn from single-loop learning
-   rethink the fundamental assumptions about the problem and if the
    policy is the right tool
-   learn about inherent values, goals, and assumptions

::: section
## An Urge to Learn

1.  Improve performance and outcomes

    -   internally, within and organization

2.  Normative expectations

    -   we believe gov't and policy makers should learn
    -   we institutionalize learning through evaluation, after-action
        reports, etc.
:::

::: section
## Three Types of Policy-Oriented Learning

1.  **Instrumental Learning**

    -   learning about the best means to achieve a given end

2.  **Social Learning**

    -   learning about the values and goals that underlie a policy
    -   examine the social construction of the problem
    -   seeks to determine if the worked in a specific environment
:::

::: section
## Three Types of Policy-Oriented Learning

3.  **Political Learning**
    -   learning about the political environment and how to navigate it
    -   learning about the political feasibility of a policy
    -   focus on ho to make more effective arguments for a policy
