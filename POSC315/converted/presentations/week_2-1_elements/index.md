::: section
## The Stages Model

-   **Issue Emergence**: A problem is identified and brought to the
    attention of government officials and the public.
-   **Agenda Setting**: The problem is placed on the government agenda
    for consideration.
-   **Alternative Selection**: The government considers various policy
    options to address the problem.
:::

::: section
-   **Policy Implementation**: The government implements the policy.
-   **Policy Evaluation**: The government evaluates the policy to
    determine its effectiveness.
    -   **Policy Maintenance, Succession, or Termination**: The
        government decides to maintain, modify, or terminate the policy.
-   **Issue Emergence**: What new issues emerge as the policy is
    maintained, modified, or terminated?
:::

::: section
## Stages Model Strengths

-   **Intuitive**: The stages model is easy to understand and explain.
-   **Descriptive**: The stages model describes the policy process in a
    way that is consistent with how people think about the policy
    process.
-   **Flexible**: The stages model can be adapted to different policy
    areas and levels of government.
:::

::: section
## Stages Model Weaknesses

-   **Linear**: The stages model assumes that the policy process is
    linear and sequential.
-   **Oversimplified**: The stages model oversimplifies the policy
    process by ignoring the complexity of the policy process.
-   **Separate**: The stages model separates the policy process into
    distinct stages, but in reality, the stages overlap and interact
    with each other.

## Systems Thinking

-   A way of thinking about natural or social phenomena as a system with
    various inputs that are processed and intermingle to create a
    discernible set of outputs.
-   A way of thinking about the world that emphasizes the relationships
    among the parts of a system and how the parts interact with each
    other and the system as a whole.
:::

::: section
## The Systems Model

-   Public policy is viewed as the response of the political system to
    forces brought to bear on it from the outside environment.
-   A policy environment surrounds the political system.
    -   Forces enter the political system from the environment either as
        demands or as support

## The Systems Model

:::

::: section
## The Systems Model

-   **Policy Environment**: The political, economic, and social context
    in which the policy is developed and implemented.
-   **Inputs**: The demands and expectations of the public, interest
    groups, and government officials.
-   **Throughputs**: The policy process is the interaction between the
    policy environment and the political system. This is the "black box"
    of the policy process.
:::

::: section
## The Systems Model

-   **Outputs**: The policy outputs are the laws, regulations, and
    decisions that are created by the policy process.
-   **Feedback**: The feedback is the response to the policy outputs.
-   **Policy Outcomes**: The policy outcomes are the effects of the
    policy outputs and feedback.
:::

::: section
## Systems Model Strengths

-   **Holistic**: The systems model is holistic because it considers the
    policy environment, the political system, and the policy process.
-   **Dynamic**: The systems model is dynamic because it considers the
    interaction between the policy environment and the political system.
-   **Flexible**: The systems model can be adapted to different policy
    areas and levels of government.
:::

::: section
## Systems Model Weaknesses

-   **Complex**: The systems model is complex because it considers the
    policy environment, the political system, and the policy process.
-   **Abstract**: The systems model is abstract because it does not
    provide a clear explanation of the policy process.

# The Policy Environment
:::

::: section
## The Structural Environment

-   **Political System**: The political system is the set of formal and
    informal political institutions that make and implement collective
    decisions.
    -   The basic features of American government are the separation of
        powers, federalism, and checks and balances.
:::

::: section
## The Social Environment

-   **Political Culture**: The political culture is the set of shared
    beliefs, values, and norms that influence the political system.
    -   The basic features of American political culture are liberty,
        equality, democracy, civic duty, and individual responsibility.
:::

::: section
## The Social Environment

-   Changing Demographics
    -   The population of the United States is becoming
        -   more diverse, older, more urban, more educated, more mobile.
-   The government must respond to these changing needs
:::

::: section
## The Economic Environment

-   **Economic Conditions**: The economic conditions are the state of
    the economy.
    -   The basic features of the economy are the business cycle,
        inflation, unemployment, and economic growth.
    -   Measured by GDP, size of industrial sector, unemployment rate,
        inflation rate, etc.
:::

::: section
## The Political Environment

-   Often measured by the **National Mood**.
    -   The national mood is the public's general attitude toward
        government and politics.
    -   Measured by the **Direction of the Country** question in public
        opinion polls.
    -   Measured by the **Presidential Approval Rating** question in
        public opinion polls.
