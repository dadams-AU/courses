## Why Study Policy Process Theories?

::: key-concept
Theories help us:
:::

-   Understand how policies change over time
-   Identify key factors in policy development
-   Predict when change might occur
-   Analyze past policy successes and failures
::::

::::: section
## Kingdon\'s Multiple Streams Framework (MSF)

::: key-concept
Policy windows open when three independent streams converge:
:::

-   **Problem Stream:** Issues gaining attention (e.g., opioid crisis)
-   **Policy Stream:** Available solutions (e.g., harm reduction
    policies)
-   **Politics Stream:** Political conditions (e.g., bipartisan support
    for intervention)

\
\

*Example:* The Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, where environmental
crises, policy solutions, and political leadership converged.

## Key Components of the Three Streams Model

::: key-concept
Key Components:
:::

-   **Policy Entrepreneurs:** Individuals or groups who promote policy
    solutions
-   **Policy Windows:** Opportunities for policy change when the streams
    align
-   **Coupling:** The process of linking the streams together
::::

::::: section
## Advocacy Coalition Framework

::: key-concept
Policy change through competing belief systems
:::

-   Groups form around shared beliefs
-   Compete to influence policy
-   Learn and adapt over time

\
\

::: {.example .fragment}
*Example:* The long-term debate between environmentalists and the fossil
fuel industry over climate policies.

## Technical Details: Advocacy Coalition Framework

::: key-concept
The ACF involves:
:::

-   **Coalitions:** Groups of actors who share beliefs and coordinate
    actions
-   **Policy Subsystems:** The focus of coalitions\' activities, such as
    specific policy areas
-   **Policy Brokers:** Individuals who mediate between coalitions

\
\

::: {.example .fragment}
*Example:* Coalitions of environmental groups and industry
representatives in the energy policy subsystem.
:::
:::::

::::: section
## Key Components of the ACF

::: key-concept
Key Components:
:::

-   **Belief Systems:** Deep core beliefs, policy core beliefs, and
    secondary aspects
-   **Policy Learning:** Changes in beliefs or strategies based on new
    information
-   **External Events:** Factors outside the subsystem that can
    influence policy change

\
\

::: {.example .fragment}
*Example:* The impact of economic crises or natural disasters on policy
learning and coalition strategies.
:::

::::: section
## Punctuated Equilibrium Theory

::: key-concept
Policy changes through:
:::

-   Long periods of stability
-   Sudden, dramatic shifts
-   New policy \"equilibrium\"

\
\

::: {.example .fragment}
*Example:* Major civil rights legislation, such as the Civil Rights Act
of 1964, which marked a sudden shift after years of incremental change.

## Key Components of PET

::: key-concept
Key Components:
:::

-   **Policy Images:** How issues are perceived and understood
-   **Venue Shopping:** Efforts to move issues to favorable
    decision-making arenas
-   **Policy Entrepreneurs:** Actors who promote significant changes

\
\

::: {.example .fragment}
*Example:* The shift in gun control policy debates following
high-profile mass shootings.

## Summary

::: key-concept
Key Takeaways:
:::

-   Policy process theories help us understand and predict policy
    changes
-   *Kingdon\'s MSF* highlights the convergence of problem, policy, and
    politics streams
-   The *Advocacy Coalition Framework* focuses on belief systems and
    coalition dynamics
-   *Punctuated Equilibrium Theory* explains long periods of stability
    interrupted by sudden changes

*Use these frameworks to analyze and interpret policy developments in
your term paper.*

## Looking Ahead: Term Paper

::: key-concept
You\'ll apply these theories to analyze a policy of your choice
:::

-   Choose a policy issue that interests you
-   Select one or more theories to analyze it
-   Build your analysis step by step

*First step: Topic selection due Week 4*
