-   It's purposefully **vague**:

    -   Allows the government to grow and respond to needs
-   It lasts because of its *elasticity*.

    responsibilities into distinct branches to limit any one branch from
    exercising the core functions of another

-   allows states to experiment with different policies
-   keeps government closer to the people
-   increases political participation
