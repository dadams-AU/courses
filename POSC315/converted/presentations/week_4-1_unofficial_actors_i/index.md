## Interaction of Actors

-   **Policy Regime**
    -   \"A loosely formed governance structure formed by a policy
        community around a particularly broad policy domain.\" -
        Birkland

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   -   When a policy domain is broad and spans boundaries of various
        types, the actors, coalitions, interests, and agencies form a
        policy regime---a loose governance structure.
