-   Policies can turn uninvolved citizens into engaged participants
:::

::: section

# Classic Policy Typologies

:::: section
## Distributive Policies

::: definition
**Definition**: Takes resources from a broad group and gives benefits to
specific groups or individuals
:::

-   Often results from \"logrolling\" or \"pork barrel\" politics
    (trading favors)
-   Creates \"Interest Group Liberalism\" where:
    -   Government tries to please many narrow interests
    -   Specific groups benefit but the broader public interest may
        suffer
::::

::: section
## Distributive Policies: Characteristics

-   Interest groups form specifically to protect and expand these
    policies
-   Generally popular with politicians, bureaucrats, the media, and the
    public
-   Usually difficult to change or eliminate once established
-   Resistant to reform efforts
:::

:::: section
## Distributive Policies: Examples

## Distributive Policies: Equity Considerations

### Equality vs. Equity

-   Equality means everyone gets the same thing
-   Equity means distributions that are fair, even if not equal

In the U.S. context, we focus on equal opportunity, not equal outcomes
:::

::: section
## Distributive Policies: Three Dimensions of Equity

1.  **Recipients**: Who gets the benefits?
2.  **Item**: What is being distributed?
3.  **Process**: How are distribution decisions made?

**Definition**: Takes resources from one clearly identifiable group and
gives them to another clearly identifiable group

    -   From wealthy to less wealthy
    -   From less wealthy to wealthy
