-   Policy design in the [Alternative Selection]{.highlight} stage
    requires decisions about what \"tools\" to adopt
-   Decision-making also permeates ongoing policy design, budgeting,
    implementation, and evaluation
:::::

::::::: section
## Understanding Decision Points

:::::: two-column
::: col
### Key Considerations

-   Decisions occur throughout the policy process
-   Multiple decision points at each stage
-   Different actors involved at different points
:::

:::: col
### Complexity Spectrum

::: theory-card
**Complex:** What is the best way to reduce traffic fatalities?

**Simple:** Should we build a new bridge?

## Decision-Making Theories

Three primary theoretical frameworks to understand how decisions are
made in policy contexts:

::::::::: {style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around; margin-top: 1.5em;"}
:::: {style="text-align: center; padding: 15px; background: rgba(42, 118, 221, 0.1); border-radius: 10px; width: 25%;"}
### Rational Choice

::: {style="font-size: 0.7em;"}
Optimizing decisions based on complete information
:::
::::

:::: {style="text-align: center; padding: 15px; background: rgba(42, 118, 221, 0.2); border-radius: 10px; width: 25%;"}
### Bounded Rationality

::: {style="font-size: 0.7em;"}
Satisficing with limited information & capacity
:::

### Incrementalism

::: {style="font-size: 0.7em;"}
Making small changes from the status quo

## Rational Choice Theory

::: theory-card
The Rational-Comprehensive Model is the starting point for many
decision-making theories.
:::

::::: two-column
::: col
### Key Assumptions

-   All important factors are considered
-   Analysis of goals separate from tools
-   Goals are isolated before tools are considered
:::

::: col
### Definition of \"Good\" Policy

A *good* policy is the *technically* best policy that maximizes benefits
and minimizes costs.
:::
:::::
:::::::

::::::: section
## The \"Economic Man\"

Rational Choice depends on the existence of a perfectly rational actor:

:::::: theory-card
### Complete and Perfect Information

::::: two-column
::: col
-   About problems
-   About causes and effects
:::

::: col
-   About consequences of alternatives
-   About consequences of inaction
:::
:::::

### Perfect Calculation Ability

Can accurately weigh all costs and benefits
::::::
:::::::

::::: section
## Optimization in Rational Choice

::: theory-card
-   The rational actor chooses the option that [maximizes
    benefits]{.highlight} and [minimizes costs]{.highlight}
-   All alternatives are considered comprehensively
-   Decisions achieve maximum social gain
:::

::: {style="margin-top: 1.5em;"}
### Limitations of Rational Choice

-   Information is never complete or perfect
-   Costs and benefits are difficult to predict accurately
-   Decision-makers face resource constraints
-   Bureaucracy helps make the model more realistic
:::
:::::

::: section
## Six Steps to Rational Choice

1.  [Define the problem]{.highlight} - What exactly are we trying to
    solve?
2.  [Identify decision criteria]{.highlight} - What factors matter in
    making this decision?
3.  [Weight the criteria]{.highlight} - How important is each factor?
4.  [Generate alternatives]{.highlight} - What are all possible
    solutions?
5.  [Rate alternatives]{.highlight} - How does each solution perform on
    each criterion?
6.  [Compute optimal decision]{.highlight} - Which solution maximizes
    benefits?
:::

:::::::: section
## Rational Choice: Example

::::::: example-box
::: example-title
Case: Highway Safety Policy
:::

::::: two-column
::: col
### Problem Definition

Reduce traffic fatalities on interstate highways by 50% within 5 years

### Criteria & Weights

-   Effectiveness (40%)
-   Implementation cost (30%)
-   Time to implement (20%)
-   Public acceptance (10%)
:::

::: col
### Alternatives Analyzed

1.  Lower speed limits
2.  Increase enforcement
3.  ***Mandate vehicle safety features***
4.  Improve road design
5.  Enhance driver education

### Decision

After comprehensive analysis, the highest-scoring option is selected as
it provides optimal benefit-cost ratio.

## Bounded Rationality

::: {style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.8em;"}
Herbert Simon (1916-2001)

Nobel Prize in Economics (1978)
:::

> \"The capacity of the human mind for formulating and solving complex
> problems is very small compared with the size of the problems whose
> solution is required for objectively rational behavior in the real
> world.\"
::::

:::::::: section
## Core Concepts in Bounded Rationality

::::::: two-column
:::: col
::: theory-card
### Intertwined Elements

-   Goals and tools are considered together
-   Means and ends are not separate
-   Values and facts are interconnected
:::
::::

:::: col
::: theory-card
### Definition of \"Good\" Policy

A \"good\" policy is one where [consensus can be reached]{.highlight}
among stakeholders.
:::
::::
:::::::
::::::::

::::::: section
## The \"Administrative Man\"

Bounded rationality recognizes that human rationality is limited:

:::::: theory-card
### Rationality is \"bounded\" by:

::::: two-column
::: col
-   Limited information
-   Limited time
-   Limited cognitive capacity
:::

::: col
-   Limited resources
-   Limited information processing
-   Competing priorities
:::
:::::
::::::
:::::::

:::: section
## Satisficing in Bounded Rationality

::: theory-card
### \"Satisfice\" = \"Satisfy\" + \"Suffice\"

-   Administrative actors choose the first option that meets [minimum
    criteria]{.highlight}
-   Makes the most rational decision with available information
-   Achieves satisfactory (not maximum) social gain
-   Recognizes that further search for solutions has costs
:::

## Rational Choice vs. Bounded Rationality

  Rational Choice                 Bounded Rationality
  ------------------------------- -------------------------------------
  Complete information            Limited information
  Values and facts are separate   Values and facts are intertwined
  Goals before tools              Goals and tools considered together
  Means and ends are separate     Means and ends are intertwined
  Seeks technically best policy   Seeks policy with consensus
  Comprehensive analysis          Limited analysis
  Heavily theory-driven           More pragmatic approach
:::

:::::::: section
## Bounded Rationality: Example

::::::: example-box
::: example-title
Case: City Homelessness Response
:::

::::: two-column
::: col
### Decision Context

-   Rising homeless population
-   Mayor facing re-election in 6 months
-   Limited city budget
-   Incomplete data on homeless demographics
-   Multiple stakeholders with competing interests
:::

::: col
### Satisficing Approach

-   Review 3-4 policy options (not all possible alternatives)
-   Set minimum criteria: must be implementable within 4 months, cost
    under \$2M, and address immediate shelter needs
-   Select first option that meets all criteria
-   Choose temporary shelter expansion despite knowing it\'s not the
    comprehensive solution that would be optimal

## Incrementalism

::: {style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.8em;"}
Charles Lindblom (1917-2018)

\"The Science of Muddling Through\" (1959)
:::

::: theory-card
Builds on Herbert Simon\'s work on bounded rationality

-   Recognizes limited information processing capacity
-   Focuses on making small, manageable changes
-   Reduces risk through incremental adjustments
:::
:::::

:::: section
## Successive Limited Comparisons

::: theory-card
### Key Elements of Incremental Decision-Making

-   Compare alternatives to the [status quo]{.highlight}
-   Choose the alternative that is the [least different]{.highlight}
    from current policy
-   Incremental change becomes the norm
-   Build on existing policies rather than creating from scratch
:::
::::

:::::: section
## Benefits of Incrementalism

::::: two-column
::: col
### Simplifies Decision-Making

-   Reduces alternatives to consider
-   Focuses on marginal changes
-   Allows reliance on feedback
:::

::: col
### Manages Risk

-   Makes process serial and remedial
-   Avoids large, irreversible errors
-   Enables course correction
:::
:::::
::::::

::::: section
## Limitations of Incrementalism

::: theory-card
### Not Always Appropriate

-   Some problems are too complex for incremental solutions
-   Some problems are too urgent to address incrementally
-   Some problems require fundamental, not incremental, change
:::

::: {style="margin-top: 0.8em;"}
### When \"Muddling Through\" Won\'t Work

Some decisions require huge leaps:

-   Moonshots & major technological initiatives
-   Responses to wars & national security threats
-   Managing pandemics & public health emergencies
-   Addressing economic depressions & major recessions
:::
:::::

::::::::::::: section
## Incrementalism: Example

:::::::::::: example-box
::: example-title
Case: Environmental Regulation
:::

:::::::::: two-column
::: col
### Status Quo

-   Current emissions standard: 30 parts per million
-   Industry has invested in existing compliance technology
-   Environmental groups want 10ppm standard
-   Economic concerns about rapid changes
:::

:::::::: col
### Incremental Approach

::::::: policy-steps
::: policy-step
Year 1: Reduce to 25ppm (small change)
:::

::: policy-step
Year 3: Reduce to 20ppm (assess impacts)
:::

::: policy-step
Year 5: Reduce to 15ppm (if feasible)
:::

::: policy-step
Year 7: Consider further reductions
:::
:::::::

[Each step builds on previous experience and allows for adjustment based
on feedback and new information.]{.small}

## Dysfunctional Decision-Making

::: theory-card
Dysfunction often arises not from [disagreement]{.highlight} but from
[problematic agreement]{.highlight}.

-   Hesitation to disagree with the group
-   Difficulty speaking truth to power
-   Tendency to prioritize harmony over critical thinking
:::

Savvy administrators put safeguards in place to avoid these pitfalls.
::::

::::: section
## Groupthink

::: theory-card
### Definition

A mode of thinking where people prioritize [group cohesion]{.highlight}
and [unanimity]{.highlight} over critical evaluation of facts,
alternatives, and consequences.
:::

::: {style="margin-top: 0.8em;"}
### Historical Examples

-   The Bay of Pigs Invasion (1961)
-   The Challenger Disaster (1986)
-   The Abilene Paradox
:::

:::::::: section
## Groupthink: Example

::::::: example-box
::: example-title
Case: The Bay of Pigs Invasion (1961)
:::

::::: two-column
::: col
### Decision Context

-   Kennedy administration planning invasion of Cuba
-   High-pressure, high-stakes national security decision
-   Group of like-minded advisors
-   Strong leadership preference for action
:::

::: col
### Groupthink Symptoms

-   Illusion of invulnerability
-   Collective rationalization of warning signs
-   Suppression of dissenting views
-   Self-censorship by advisors with doubts
-   Disastrous outcome: failed invasion and international embarrassment

## The Garbage Can Model

::: theory-card
### Michael Cohen, James March, Johan Olsen (1972)

Decisions are made in an \"organized anarchy\" where problems,
solutions, participants, and choice opportunities mix together.

## The Garbage Can Model

::: theory-card
### Four Streams in the Organization

1.  Choices looking for problems
2.  Issues looking for decision situations
3.  Solutions looking for issues
4.  Decision makers looking for work
:::

When timing aligns these four streams, decisions happen - but not
necessarily in a logical or rational way.
::::

:::::::: section
## Garbage Can Model: Example

::::::: example-box
::: example-title
Case: University Curriculum Reform
:::

::::: two-column
::: col
### Elements in the \"Garbage Can\"

-   **Problems:** Declining enrollment, employer complaints about
    graduates\' skills
-   **Solutions:** New online learning platform (purchased but unused),
    faculty expertise in interdisciplinary teaching
-   **Participants:** New dean seeking to make mark, faculty committee
    members with varying agendas
-   **Choice Opportunity:** Annual curriculum review meeting
:::

::: col
### Decision Process

When these elements converge at the curriculum meeting, the online
platform (a pre-existing solution) is suddenly matched with the
enrollment problem, despite not being designed for this purpose.

[The decision appears rational but actually resulted from the timing of
streams coming together, not comprehensive analysis of
alternatives.]{.small}
