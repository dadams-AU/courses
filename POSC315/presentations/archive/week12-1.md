# Implementation

## POSC315 Week 12-1

### Implementation in the Policy Process

---


# Implementation 

#### The the process by which policies enacted by the legislative and executive branches are carried out by the bureaucracy and the courts.

* A policy is generally useless if it is not implemented.


* Implementation battles are also where significant power and debate can occur.



---

# Implementation Basics

## Possibly the most critical stage of the policy process.
* Policies are not self-executing.


* Often determines the success or failure of a policy.


--

## Governmental Agency Characteristics
* Bureaucrats have **discretion** in how they implement policies.


* Bureaucrats are not completely unbiased nor are they free to do whatever they want.
* Responsible for _translating_ goals and intent of policy into action.


---

# Implementation Studies: 
# Four Generations

---

## 1960s-1970s: The First Generation

* Theory came from case studies of specific programs.


  * Derthic's _New Towns in Town_ (1969)


  * Pressman and Wildavsky's _Implementation_ (1973)


--


## 1960s-1970s: The First Generation Lessons

* Needed commitment in the executive branch.


* Consider local needs and preferences in policy design.
* Consider and adapt to local conditions.
* There is no "one" best way to implement a policy.
* Complexity of Joint Action


--


### The Complexity of Joint Action (Bardach 1977)

1. Simple and straightforward is often complex and convoluted.


2. Different perspectives and different measures of success.
3. Diverse implementers: agreement on the means but not always on the ends.
4. All depends on _interorganizational relationships_.


--


#### **Interorganizational Relationships**

Organizations have:
* Incompatible goals


* Preferences for other policies
* Simultaneous commitments to other projects
* Dependence on others who are slow to act
* Differences of opinion on leadership
* Agreement coupled with lack of power.

--

#### **Interorganizational Relationships**


_When a policy or program depends on so many actors, there are numerous possibilities for disagreement and delay._

---

## 1980s-1990s: The Second Generation

* Theoretical development and empirical testing.


* An _era of theorizing_.
  * Systems-like models of implementation.
  * Bottom-up and top-down models.
* Strength: first attempts at creating some kind of unified theory of implementation.
* Weakness: too much emphasis on the rationality of the process.


--

### Top-Down Models

* Assumptions:
  * Policy is a rational process.


    * clear goals, tools, and policy statements.
  * Policy is a linear process.
  * Policy is a hierarchical process.   

--

#### Top-Down Models Advantages

* Clear goals and objectives.


* Overhead democracy: accountability to the public through elected officials and appointed bureaucrats.
* Clear lines of authority and responsibility: 
  * Clear credit for success or failure, i.e., there is someone to praise or blame.

--

#### Top-Down Models Disadvantages

* Policy is not a rational process.
  * Incrementalism and fragmented authority complicate this


* Emphasis on goals at the top and not on workers on the ground.
* Intergovernmental cooperation is often more difficult than expected.
* Implementers may circumvent the policy-makers' intent.

--

#### Top-Down Model Example: The Forest Service

* The Forest Service is a top-down organization.


* Are the goals always clear? 
  * The forest service has multiple goals: recreation, conservation, and resource extraction.
  * The goals are often in conflict.
  * The goals are often vague.
* What goal is the most important?
* How do you measure success?
* How do you measure failure?

--

#### Top-Down Model: Other Flaws

* Failure to consider the role of the courts.


* Doesn't always account for federalism
  * Federal officials can set guidelines better than they can hard rules
  * Local officials engage in "strategic delay"
* Most policies are based on multiple statutes and regulations.
* But... federal officials can impose roles on who implements and apply sanctions and rewards to promote a particular implementation design.

--

### Bottom-Up Models

* Assumptions:
  * Emphasis is placed on where the government meets the people.


  * **Backward mapping**: starts with policy targets and works backward to identify which implementers and policy tools might affect behavioral change.
  * Policy design considers the abilities and motivations of the lowest-level implementers, the street-level bureaucrats or the engaged target population.

--


#### Bottom-Up Models Advantages

* Emphasis on the people who actually implement the policy.
  * Implementation begins with the service deliverers and the target groups


* Recognizes goals are ambiguous and that there are multiple goals.
* Allows for **administrative discretion**, acknowledging that one size doesn't fit all.

--

#### Bottom-Up Models Advantages
* Policy is likely to reflect community needs and preferences.


* Does not require a single statute or "policy."
* Better accommodates a pluralistic society and a network of actors.
* Better accommodates federalism.


--

#### Bottom-Up Models Disadvantages

* Overemphasizes the **agency** of the implementers.


* Discretion and differentially designated authority can create ambiguous goals and accomplishments. 
* Street-level bureaucrats may subvert the intent of the policy and elected officials' goals.

--

#### Bottom-Up Models Disadvantages

* Doesn't fully recognize power differences among interest groups and coalitions, even though they are participants. 
  * Assumes that all groups have equal power and influence.
    * "Policies without publics" (Sabatier and Mazmanian 1980) often means low mobilization and low participation.
    * Target groups often lack power and influence.

--

## Let's Have Fun with a 2nd Generation Policy

### Drive 55 and Stay Alive!

* [The National Maximum Speed Law (NMSL) in 1974.](https://youtu.be/fqdFFAErG64)


* The NMSL required states to adopt a maximum speed limit of 55 mph.
* The NMSL was repealed in 1995.

---

## 2000s: The Third Generation

* Realizes implementation is communication between policymakers and implementers


* Recognizes the importance of the **policy network**.
* Synthesizes the top-down and bottom-up models.

--

### Third Generation Propositions:

#### Success 

1. Implementation is a process of communication between policymakers and implementers.


2. Success comes from sufficient resources, clear goals, and a supportive political environment.

--

#### Improvement: 

1. Strategic delay on the part of the states allows for **policy learning** and **policy diffusion**


2. This can lead to innovation and improvement as states learn from each other.

---

## 2010s: The Fourth Generation

* The fourth Generation is still being developed.


* It is a synthesis of the first three eras -- particularly an outgrowth of the 3rd Generation. 
* The general trend is to move away from long-term causal relationships and toward a more dynamic and interactive process.

--

### Fourth Generation Propositions:

* Move to **program implementation** focus instead of the policy implementation orientation of previous generations.


* Other disciplines have moved away from the linear model of policy implementation to a more dynamic and interactive process of programs
  * health, environment, education, and social welfare, planning, etc.

--

#### Program Implementation

* The programmatic focus is less on broad theories and more on _what works for a particular program_.


* Geared toward the practical considerations of making programs more effective.
* The core disciplines of political science and public administration are still focused on comprehensive causal frameworks of policy implementation.

---

# Implementation Summary

* Implementation is the process by which policies enacted by the legislative and executive branches are carried out by the bureaucracy and the courts.


* Implementation is a critical stage of the policy process.
* Implementation studies have gone through four generations of development.
