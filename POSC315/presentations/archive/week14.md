# Science and Theory of Policy Studies

## Week 14: Theories of Policy Change

### POSC 315

## Science in the Policy Process

### Laswell's Motivations

1. To create sound social science theories
2. _To Solve Problems_

---

## Science in the Policy Process

Problem solving is not always the goal of social science research.

- Gaining knowledge of the social world
- Understanding the social world
- _Basic_ versus _Applied_ research

---

### The Scientific Method

1. Identify a problem
2. Formulate a hypothesis
3. Collect data
4. Analyze data
5. Draw conclusions
6. Disseminate findings
7. Replicate
8. Build a theory
9. Test the theory
10. Modify the theory
11. Repeat

---

### Laswell's Vision

In reality, the science of public policy falls short of Laswell's vision to solve problems.

Policy theory making has shifted to the development and testing of _how_ the system works, with less emphasis on _why_ it works or how it _should_ work.

## Theories of Policy Change

### What is a theory?

A theory is a set of interrelated concepts, definitions, and propositions that explains or predicts events or situations by specifying relations among variables.

---

### What is a theory?


- generalizable
- parsimonious
- falsifiable
- internally consistent
- empirically valid
- useful

---

### What is a theory?

It is necessary for finding solutions to problems.

- It is a tool for understanding the world.
- It is a tool for understanding the policy process.
- It is a tool for understanding policy change.

---

#### Deductive and Inductive Reasoning

- Deductive reasoning is the process of reasoning from one or more general statements (premises) to reach a logically certain conclusion.

- Inductive reasoning is the process of reasoning from a set of specific observations to reach a general conclusion.

---

### What characterizes science?

- The development of theories
- The desire to broaden human knowledge
- Use of the scientific method
  - helps simplify the complex
  - drives the development of theories
  - grounded in the real world

---

### What characterizes science?

- Use of methods
  - carefully planned
  - replicable
  - evidence-based


---

### What characterizes science?

- Anecdotal evidence is not science
  - "I know a guy who..."
  - "I heard a story about..."

---

### What characterizes science?

  
- Peer review
  - The process of subjecting an author's scholarly work, research, or ideas to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field.
  - The process is used by publishers and editors of academic journals to ensure that the articles they publish meet the accepted standards of their discipline..

---

#### Anecdote vs. Evidence

| | Description | How Used | Strengths/Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Anecdote | A short and amusing or interesting story about a real incident or person. | To illustrate a point. | Anecdotes are useful for making a point, but they are not evidence. |
| Evidence | The available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid. | To support a point. | Evidence is the basis of science. |

## Theories of Policy Change

### Shared ideas among several approaches to policy change:

- policy making is complex
- decision makers are bounded in their rationality
- individuals are serial processors of information
- participation is more or less open, but not equal in terms of influence and power
- information is imperfect and incomplete

### Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h4>Problem Stream</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Problem Recognition:</strong> Identifying issues that require government action.</li>
      <li><strong>Problem Definition:</strong> Framing the issue to gain attention.</li>
      <li><strong>Problem Legitimation:</strong> Gaining acceptance that the issue is worthy of policy action.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h4>Policy Stream</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Policy Proposals:</strong> Generating potential solutions.</li>
      <li><strong>Policy Legitimation:</strong> Garnering support for policy solutions.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h4>Politics Stream</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Political Climate:</strong> The overall mood and attitudes influencing policy decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Political Power:</strong> The influence of various stakeholders and interest groups.</li>
      <li><strong>Political Events:</strong> Significant happenings that impact policy decisions.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

### Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework

- Policy entrepreneurs
  - Individuals who are willing to invest their resources in order to promote their policy preferences
  - They are willing to invest their resources because they believe in their policy preferences and they believe they can influence the policy process

---

### Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework

- Basic idea
  - Policy change occurs when the three streams converge
  - Policy entrepreneurs are the agents of change

---

### Advocacy Coalition Framework

- Policy subsystems
  - A set of actors who are interdependent in the policy process
  - They share a set of beliefs about policy problems and solutions
  - They engage in a variety of activities to influence policy change


---

### Advocacy Coalition Framework

#### Policy subsystems
- Policy actors
  - Advocates
  - Opponents
  - Neutral parties
- Policy beliefs
  - Deep core beliefs
  - Policy core beliefs
  - Secondary aspects of policy beliefs

---

### Advocacy Coalition Framework

- Basic idea 
    - Policy change occurs when the policy core beliefs of the dominant coalition in a policy subsystem change
    - Policy actors are the agents of change
    - Policy actors are motivated by their policy core beliefs

---

### Advocacy Coalition Framework

- Important Aspects
  - Coalitions help to explain group alliance formation
  - Coalitions can persist through enactment and implementation
  - Coalitions can be stable or unstable and come apart when policy core beliefs change or deep core beliefs are threatened

---

### Punctuated Equilibrium Theory

- General idea
  - Policy change occurs in bursts
  - Policy change is followed by long periods of stability
  - Policy change is driven by external events
  - Policy change is driven by policy-oriented learning

---

### Punctuated Equilibrium Theory

- The balance of political power between groups is relatively stable over long periods of time

- This balance of power is *punctuated* by sudden shifts in:
  - public understanding of policy problems
  - the balance of power between groups seeking to fight for or against policy change

---

### Punctuated Equilibrium Theory

- Based on policy monopolies:
  - Policy monopolies are groups that dominate the policy process
  - they form a subsystem
  - they are able to control the policy agenda with a relatively few number of policy actors
    - this leads to policy stability but
    - an inability to respond to external events

---

### Punctuated Equilibrium Theory

- How do policy monopolies break down?
  - Media attention to an issue
  - A change in the balance of power between groups
  - A change in the policy image caused by policy-oriented learning
  - A change in the policy venue
  
When a policy monopoly breaks down, policy change occurs in a burst!

### Institutional Analysis and Development Framework

Focuses on how institutions (rules, norms, and strategies) govern collective action, especially in managing common pool resources.

--

### Institutional Analysis and Development Framework


- Key Components
  - **Action Arena**: Where individuals interact, make decisions, and influence outcomes.
  - **Participants**: Individuals/groups with varied objectives and levels of control.
  - **Levels of Analysis**: Operational (day-to-day decisions), Collective-Choice (institutional rules), Constitutional (fundamental rules).


---

### Institutional Analysis and Development Framework

- Process
   - Identify resources and participants.
   - Analyze interaction patterns and outcomes.
   - Evaluate how different rules affect actions and outcomes.

---

### Socioecological Systems Framework


- Application
  -  Useful in analyzing diverse problems, from local governance to global environmental issues.
  -  Emphasizes the importance of local knowledge and conditions in policy design.

---

### Socioecological Systems Framework

- Focuses on the interactions between social and ecological systems.
- Developed to address the limitations of studying social and ecological systems separately.

--

### Socioecological Systems Framework


- Core Concepts
  - **Interconnected Systems**: Social and ecological systems are interconnected and interdependent.
  - **Resilience and Adaptation**: Systems are resilient when they can absorb disturbances and adapt to change.

---

### Socioecological Systems Framework

- Frameworks
  -  Uses nested frameworks to analyze interactions at multiple scales (local, regional, global).
  -  Emphasizes the role of governance, institutions, and human behavior in ecological outcomes.

---

### Socioecological Systems Framework

- Application
  -  Applied in climate change policy, sustainable resource management, and conservation efforts.
   - Encourages holistic policy approaches considering both environmental and social dimensions.

---

## Summary

- Theories are important for understanding the policy process and policy change.
- We've reviewed five theories of policy change:
- This discussion is not exhaustive, but it is representative of the types of theories that are used to understand policy changeâ€”it's a starting point.
- These models can help us think about how the process works, and about how we might influence the process.
