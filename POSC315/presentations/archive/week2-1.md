## The Stages Model

- **Issue Emergence**: A problem is identified and brought to the attention of government officials and the public.
  
- **Agenda Setting**: The problem is placed on the government agenda for consideration.
  
- **Alternative Selection**: The government considers various policy options to address the problem.

--

- **Policy Implementation**: The government implements the policy.
  
- **Policy Evaluation**: The government evaluates the policy to determine its effectiveness.
  - **Policy Maintenance, Succession, or Termination**: The government decides to maintain, modify, or terminate the policy.
  
- **Issue Emergence**: What new issues emerge as the policy is maintained, modified, or terminated?

--

## Stages Model Strengths
- **Intuitive**: The stages model is easy to understand and explain.
  
- **Descriptive**: The stages model describes the policy process in a way that is consistent with how people think about the policy process.
  
- **Flexible**: The stages model can be adapted to different policy areas and levels of government.

--

## Stages Model Weaknesses
- **Linear**: The stages model assumes that the policy process is linear and sequential.
  
- **Oversimplified**: The stages model oversimplifies the policy process by ignoring the complexity of the policy process.
  
- **Separate**: The stages model separates the policy process into distinct stages, but in reality, the stages overlap and interact with each other.


---

## Systems Thinking

  - A way of thinking about natural or social phenomena as a system with various inputs that are processed and intermingle to create a discernible set of outputs.
  
  - A way of thinking about the world that emphasizes the relationships among the parts of a system and how the parts interact with each other and the system as a whole.


--

## The Systems Model

- Public policy is viewed as the response of the political system to forces brought to bear on it from the outside environment.

- A policy environment surrounds the political system.  
  - Forces enter the political system from the environment either as demands or as support

## The Systems Model

- **Policy Environment**: The political, economic, and social context in which the policy is developed and implemented.

- **Inputs**: The demands and expectations of the public, interest groups, and government officials.

- **Throughputs**: The policy process is the interaction between the policy environment and the politcal system. This is the "black box" of the policy process.

--

## The Systems Model

- **Outputs**: The policy outputs are the laws, regulations, and decisions that are created by the policy process.
  
- **Feedback**: The feedback is the response to the policy outputs.

- **Policy Outcomes**: The policy outcomes are the effects of the policy outputs and feedback.

--

## Systems Model Strengths
- **Holistic**: The systems model is holistic because it considers the policy environment, the political system, and the policy process.
  
- **Dynamic**: The systems model is dynamic because it considers the interaction between the policy environment and the political system.
  
- **Flexible**: The systems model can be adapted to different policy areas and levels of government.

--

## Systems Model Weaknesses
- **Complex**: The systems model is complex because it considers the policy environment, the political system, and the policy process.

- **Abstract**: The systems model is abstract because it does not provide a clear explanation of the policy process.

    - more diverse, older, more urban, more educated, more mobile.
- The government must respond to these changing needs

--

## The Economic Environment
- **Economic Conditions**: The economic conditions are the state of the economy.
  
    - The basic features of the economy are the business cycle, inflation, unemployment, and economic growth.
    - Measured by GDP, size of industrial sector, unemployment rate, inflation rate, etc. 

--

## The Political Environment
- Often measured by the **National Mood**.
  - The national mood is the public's general attitude toward government and politics.
  - Measured by the **Direction of the Country** question in public opinion polls.  
  - Measured by the **Presidential Approval Rating** question in public opinion polls.
