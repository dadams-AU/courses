# Official Actors in the Policy Process

## Theories of Interaction

---

## Theoretical Approaches

  1. Institutionalism
  2. Behavioralism
  3. Neo-Institutionalism

--

## Institutionalism

- The study of politics and policy based on the interaction of formal institutions in government.
- Focuses on the formal rules and procedures that structure politics and policy.
- Decision-making is placed in the context of the relationships between institutions.

--

## Behavioralism

- Narrows individual political motivation and behavior to a few key factors.
- It understands individual and group behavior through incentives and disincentives.
- Decision-making is placed in the context of the relationships between individuals and groups.

--

## Neo-Institutionalism

- Combines the two approaches.
- A sociological view of institutions--the way they interact and how they affect social behavior.
- Institutions determine the behavior and actions of individuals and groups.
- Analyzes market and organizational behavior and development in terms of rational choices and economic theories of the firm.

---

## Inertia

- **Inertia**: a property of matter by which it continues in its existing state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line, unless that state is changed by an external force.
- **Law of Inertia**: a body at rest will remain at rest, and a body in motion will remain in motion unless it is acted upon by an external force.

--

## Institutional Inertia

- The tendency of institutions to continue doing what they have been doing.
- Beuraucratic organizations tend ot perpetuate established procedures and modes, even if they are counter productive or opposed to established goals.
- Organizations tend to take on a life of their own.

--

## Other Definitions

- **Path dependency**: the tendency of institutions to follow established patterns of behavior.
- **Incrementalism**: the tendency of institutions to make small changes to existing policies.
- **Punctuated equilibrium**: the tendency of institutions to make large changes to existing policies.

---

## Two Types of Policy Acotrs

1. **Official actors**: those who are formally recognized as having a role in the policy process.
2. **Unofficial actors**: those who are not formally recognized as having a role in the policy process but have a motivation to participate.

--

## Official Actors Examples

- **Legislator**: a member of a legislative body, e.g., a member of the U.S. Congress.
- **Executive**: a person or group of persons having administrative or supervisory authority in government.
- **Bureaucrat**: an official in a government department, in particular one perceived as being concerned with procedural correctness at the expense of people's needs.
- **Judge**: a public official appointed to decide cases in a court of law.

--

## Unofficial Actors Examples

- **Interest group**: a group of people that seeks to influence public policy on the basis of a particular common interest or concern.
- **Media**: the main means of mass communication (broadcasting, publishing, and the Internet) regarded collectively.
- **Think tank**: a body of experts providing advice and ideas on specific political or economic problems.
- **Lobbyist**: a person who takes part in an organized attempt to influence legislators.

## Official Actors

---

## Legislators

- Primary responsibliity is to make laws.
- Primary goad is to get re-elected.

--

- Legislative action is partly manipulated by coalition leaders; partly constrained by anticipating future elections; and they are partly free agents.
- Legislators are constrained by the rules of the legislative body.
- Legislators must pay attention to shifts in elite or mass opnion, as well as focusing events that can change the political agenda.

--

- We measure legsilative activity by the number of bills introduced, the number of bills passed, and the number of bills vetoed.
- **Casework**: the response of legislators to the requests of constituents for information or help in dealing with government agencies.
- **(Sub)Committees**: where much of the work of the legislature is done.

--

Today, ideology guides legislation more than pragmatisim as Congress _lurches_ from one item or crisis to the next.

---

## Executive

- Primary responsibility is to execute the laws.
- Primary goal is to get re-elected.

--

- The executive is constrained by the rules of the executive branch.
- Institutional inertia often determines where the executive will focus thier attention.
- The executive is reactionary, responding to events, crises, and the media.

--

- **Policy Entrepreneur**: executive can focus the attention of the public and the legislature on a particular issue.
- **Mass Appeal**: executive can use the media to focus the attention of the public on a particular issue.

--

- We measure executive activity by the number of executive orders issued, the number of bills signed, and the number of bills vetoed.
- The executive often has better access to information than the legislature.
- The executive has administrative control over the bureaucracy.

---

## Bureaucrat

- Primary responsibility is to implement the laws.
- Bureau and agency heads are appointed by the executive and confirmed by the legislature.
- Administrative agencies have a fixed jurisdiction and a fixed set of rules and procedures.

--

- Bureaucrats are constrained by the rules of the agency.
- Hierarchical structure of the agency determines the flow of information and the flow of decision-making.
- Provide public services, regulate the economy, and make and enforce rules.

--

- **Street-level bureaucrats**: bureaucrats who interact directly with the public.
- **Administrative discretion**: bureaucrats have the authority to make decisions about how to implement the law.

--

- We measure bureaucratic activity by the number of rules and regulations issued, the number of cases handled, and the number of cases appealed.
- **Public Goods**: goods that are non-rivalrous and non-excludable.

---

## Judge

- Primary responsibility is to interpret the laws.
- Judges are often appointed by the executive and confirmed by the legislature.
- Judges are constrained by the rules of the court.
  
--

## SCOTUS

- **Judicial Review**: the power of the courts to declare laws unconstitutional, found in Article III of the Constitution and established by [Marbury v. Madison](https://youtu.be/hOvsZyqRfCo).
- **Original Jurisdiction**: the authority of a court to hear a case first.
- **Appellate Jurisdiction**: the authority of a court to hear a case on appeal.

--

- Courts have a significant role in policy making.
- Court pays attention to organized interests, which often shape the agenda.
- Court can reframe and shift the agenda of other policy actors.
- SCOTUS is the keeper and interpreter of the Constitution _and_ American values.
