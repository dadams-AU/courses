# Policy Typologies

- Hep to predict what sort of politics will accompany kinds of policies
- Categories aren't always perfect
- A policy can transofrm into different types over time
- A policy can fit into more than one category at the same time

---

# Classic Policy Typologies

---

# Distributive Policies

- **Takes a resource from a broad group of people and gives it to a smaller group of people**
  - Can result from _logrolling_ or _pork barrel_ politics
- Often results in **Interest Group Liberalism**
  - Government accomodates a wide range of narrow interests
  - Particular interests are served, but the public interest is not

---

# Distributive Policies

## Equity

- But what about equality? What about fairness?
  - Equality denotes sameness or uniform distribution

- Equity denotes distributions regarded as fair, even though they may contain inequalities and equalities
  - In the U.S. context, we have equal opportunity, not equal outcomes

---

# Distributive Policies

## Three Dimensions of Equity

- The **Recpients** of the policy
  - Who gets the benefits?
- The **Item** of the policy
  - What is being distributed?
- The **Process** of the policy
  - How is the distribution made?

---

# Redistributive Policies

- **Policies that take (or seem to take) resoruces from one identifiable group and gives them to another identifiable group**
- Manipulate the allocation of wealth, property, and personal or civil rights
- Works two ways:

- Not always about money
