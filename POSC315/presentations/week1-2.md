## Let's start with a couple of questions:

## Introduction

- We seek to understand and find solutions for public problems.
  
- We have many theories about how the policy process works.
  - Many are _interdisciplinary_.

--

- We will focus on the _politics_ of policy.
  - How do we get from a problem to a solution?
  - How do we get from a solution to a policy?
  - How do we get from a policy to a program?
  - How do we get from a program to an outcome?

--

Across the political landscape, we have many different views about what things are problems, what are the solutions to those problems, whether a government program is the best way to solve those problems, and what are the best ways to implement solutions.

--

- __Public Policy__ is the course of action the government takes in response to an issue or problem.
  
- Public policy is political because it takes place in the _public sphere_.

- Public policy addresses problems that are public or problems that some members of society think _should_ be public.

## Why Political Theory and Public Policy?

>“[A]s students of the policy process ... we need to carefully and scientifically understand why it is that money is so important in politics, why legislative processes can seem so confusing and slow, and whether and to what extent politics as currently practiced really works as a way of organizing our society.”

Birkland (chapt 2)

## Policy for the Common Good

- Policy is:
  - meaning-making
  - a statement by a government about what it intends to do about a public problem
  - what government chooses _not_ to do.

--

Policy for the Common Good

>“Policies are revealed through texts, practices, symbols, and discourses that define and deliver values including goods and services as well as regulations, incomes, status, and other positively or negatively valued attributes.”

Deborah Stone

---

## Goals of the Policy Process
- Solve, not regulate
- Bring together multiple perspectives
- Activate local knowledge
- Increase capacity for self-governance
- Attempt to produce a common good
- Continuity

---

## CHANGE: The Basic Tension in the Policy Sciences

- How does policy change happen?
  
- How does social learning occur?
  - Manipulation?
  - Relationships?
  
- How does change happen without the government?

---

## Policy Consists of Participation, Observation, and Capacity Building

--

- Participation
  - Who participates in the policy process?
  - Who is excluded?
  - How do we get more people to participate?
  - How do we get more people to participate in a meaningful way?

--


- Observation
  - How do we know what is going on?
  - How do we know what is working and what is not?
  - How do we know what is a problem and what is not?

--


- Capacity Building
  - How do we build the capacity of individuals and communities to participate and observe?

---

## The Common Will
Policy is an attempt to translate the popular will into a political reality.
  - In a liberal democracy, the popular will is expressed through elections; it is derived from the people.
  - When advocates convince the government to make a policy, one can claim the government does so in the _public interest_.

--

## The Public Interest
The assumed broader desires and needs of the public, in whose name policy is made.
  - The public interest is a contested concept.
  - The public interest is a political concept.
  - The public interest is a moral concept.

--

## The Public Interest
- Hard to define:
  - Who gets to define it?
- Advocates claim _their_ preferences are in the public interest.
- When something goes wrong, we claim the government is not acting in the public interest.
- It changes over time.
