## The News Media

"Politicians and the news media create a world of political fictions by developing causal stories that determine to whom and to where or to what blame is affixed." - Deborah Stone.

---

## The News Media

They devote time to specific issues over others, moving items up to the national agenda and onto the policy agenda of official actors.

---

## The News Media

- They use a game scheme to cover politics
  - "Who's ahead?"
  - "Who's behind?"
  - "Who's going to win?"
  - "Who's going to lose?"
- They define the boundaries of the game.

---

## The News Media

- They can be a source of information for the public, but they can also be a source of misinformation.
- Structure complex problems to suit policymakers but distort the public's perceptions.

## The News Media

### Pack Journalism

  - "The tendency of journalists to cover the same stories in the same way because they are competing with each other for audience attention." - Stone
  - gives credibility to the story and the source
  - lends to a "herd mentality" in the news media
  - can lead to a lack of diversity in coverage

---

## The News Media

- Decreasing attention spans
