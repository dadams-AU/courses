# Setting the Agenda

## Problems, Group Theory, Agenda Setting, Political Power, and Strategies for Inducing Policy Change

### POSC 315 - Dr. David P. Adams - Fall 2023

---

# Problems

## Condition or Problem? 

### Condition: something for which very little can be done.

### Problem: something that policy can address

* Over time, conditions can become problems.

---

# Problems

## The Social Construction of Problems

* **Social Construction**: the process by which people define reality, influenced by the political context and the actions of political actors.
* **Social Construction of Problems**: the process of defining problems and "selling" a broad population on the definition.

---

# Problems

## The Social Construction of Problems

### We use **symbols**, **numbers**, and **stories** to define problems.

* **Symbols**: words, phrases, or images that evoke a particular meaning or set of meanings.
* **Numbers**: statistics, data, and other numerical information that can be used to define a problem.
* **Stories**: narratives that can be used to define a problem.
  * Conspiracy theories and horror stories usually lack evidence but are very powerful.
  * Causal stories: explain the causes of a problem.
---

# Group Theory

## The group that successfully describes a problem will also be the one that defines solutions to it.

---

# Group Theory

## Groups promote their issues and fight to keep others off the agenda. 

---

## Two Theories of Groups

1. **Pluralism**: 
    * Many groups compete in a relatively _open_ political system.
    * Policy is the outcome of this competition.
2. **Elitism**: 
    * Policymaking is dominated by the most educated, wealthiest, and most powerful groups.
    * Policy is the outcome of the competition between these groups.

---

# The Agenda

## The **agenda** is the list of things being discussed and sometimes acted upon by a political body, the news media, or the public at large.

---

# Other Agenda Definitions

1. An underlying ideological plan.
2. A collection of public problems that come to the _attention_ of members of the public and their governmental officials. These include the related:
   1. causes
   2. symbols
   3. solutions
   4. and other matters that are the focus of attention.
3. A concrete list of bills before a legislature.

---

# Other Agenda Definitions

4. A **series of beliefs** out the _existence_ and _magnitude_ of problems and how they should be addressed by the government, the private sector, nonprofit organizations, or through joint action by some or all of these actors.
5. **Hidden agendas**, which reflect the American value of distrusting government and the belief that government officials and other actors are not always honest about their true intentions.
6. **Overt agendas**, which are the stated goals of government officials and other actors.

---

# Agenda Setting

## Agendas exist all levels of government: every community and government has a **collection of issues** that are available for discussion and action.

---

# Agenda Setting

## Agenda setting is the process by which problems and alternative solutions gain or lose public and elite attention.

---

# Agenda Setting

## The activities of various actors and groups that cause issues to gain or lose _attention_*_ are called **agenda-setting**.
## **Political power** is used to keep ideas and issues on or off the agenda.

---

# Agenda Competition

* There are too many possible problems and possible solutions that no one society or government can address.
* The competition for attention is fierce.
* Substantial competition for a very limited agenda space. 

---

# Agenda Competition

## Defining a problem involves considerable:
* difficulty, 
* competition among groups vying for their preferred solutions, and
* possible controversy and conflict. 

---

# Levels of the Agenda

## There are four levels of the agenda:
1. **Agenda Universe**: the collection of all possible issues.
2. **Systemic agenda**: the collection of issues perceived by the public, media, and government members as meriting public attention and governmental action.
3. **Institutional agenda**: the collection of issues that are up for active and serious consideration by a governmental body.
4. **Decision agenda**: the collection of issues that are actually acted upon by a governmental body.

---

# Levels of the Agenda
 * These levels exist in multiple phase spaces. 
 * We can think of multiple levels of the agenda for each of the following:
   * The public
   * The media
   * The government
   * The courts
   * The bureaucracy
   * The President
   * The Congress
   * The Supreme Court
   * The states
   * The local governments
 * Each of these levels has its own agenda universe, systemic, institutional, and decision agendas. 

---

# Levels of the Agenda

## The **agenda universe** is the collection of all possible issues.
* Any possible idea that could every be considered by a government or society, at any time and in any place, is part of the agenda universe.

---

# Levels of the Agenda

## The **systemic agenda** is the collection of issues perceived by the public, media, and government members as meriting public attention and governmental action.
* Any issue, problem, or idea that could possibly considered by participants in each political system as long as it doesn't fall outside well-established norms and values.

---

# Levels of the Agenda

## The boundary between the **systemic agenda** and the **agenda universe** is the **gatekeeping** function of the media, government, and other actors.
* This boundary is not static. From time to time, the boundaries can change regarding what is or is not considered acceptable for government action.

---

# Levels of the Agenda

## The **institutional agenda** is the collection of issues that are up for active and serious consideration by a governmental body.
* These are the issues that are receiving serious _attention_ from the government and the public.

---

# Levels of the Agenda

## Only a limited number of issues and problems reach the **institutional agenda**.
* The **institutional agenda** is a subset of the **systemic agenda**.
* Limited attention and resources mean that only a small number of issues can be considered at any one time.
* In legislative bodies, the committee structure helps to expand the carrying capacity of the agendaâ€”the division of labor effect.

---

# Levels of the Agenda

## The **decision agenda** is the collection of issues that are actually acted upon by a governmental body.
* The **decision agenda** is a subset of the **institutional agenda**.
* These are items that are up for a vote or a decision by a governmental body.

---

# Agenda Setting

## **Conflict Expansion** is the key goal of many interest groups, and it can move items from the **systemic agenda** to the **institutional agenda** or from the **institutional agenda** to the **decision agenda** and vice versa.

* Conflict is greatest at the **discision agenda** level.
* A decision reached at one level or branch of government may trigger or expand the conflict at another level or branch of government.

---

# Agenda Setting

## Attention Matters!

* Attention sets the policy agenda
* Priorities often determine where attention is placed.
* Major events often shift priorities and attention allocation.

---

# Agenda Setting

## Attention Complications

* We live in a world of _imperfect_ and _costly_ information. Those who can persuade and use their power to get attention can shape the agenda.
* Attention bottlenecks occur when there is too much information, forcing us to focus on some things while ignoring others.

---

# Agenda Setting

## Attention Expansion

### Indicators
* When the numbers or statistics look bad, the problem is more likely to get attention.
* e.g., unemployment, inflation, crime, etc.
* These indicators become _symbols_ of the problem.

---

# Agenda Setting

## Attention Expansion

### Focusing Events

* A major event that draws attention to a problem.
* Attention can spike in the agenda space when a major event occurs, forcing policymakers, the media, and the public to focus on the issue. 
* e.g., 9/11, the Challenger explosion, the BP oil spill, etc.
* Some groups take advantage of these events to push their own agendas.

---

# Political Power and Groups

## Political power is the ability to get things done in a political system.

---

# Political Power and Groups

## **Losing Groups** are those who are unable to get their issues on the agenda or to get their preferred solutions adopted.
* They have two ways to expand the scope of the conflict:
  1. Use symbols to change the nature of the policy debate, induce sympathy, and gain support.
  2. Appeal to a higher level or another branch of government.

---

# Political Power and Groups

## **Winning Groups** are those that can get their issues on the agenda and adopt their preferred solutions.
* They have a **policy monopoly** over an issue.
* They reinforce their own symbols and narratives.
* They use their power to keep other groups off the agenda.
* They keep public attention directed away from their policy preferences. 

---

# Three Types of Political Power

1. **Coercive Power**
2. **Blocking Power**
3. **Quiescence or Powerlessness**

---

# Three Types of Political Power

## **Coercive Power** is the ability to force someone to do something they would not otherwise do.
* e.g., the police, the military, etc.
* Coercive power is the most obvious form of power, but it is **not** the most common form of power in a democracy.
* Easy to use in a totalitarian regime, but not in a democracy.

---

# Three Types of Political Power

## **Blocking Power** is the ability to prevent someone from doing something they would otherwise do.
* e.g., the filibuster, the veto, etc.
* Blocking power is the most common form of power in a democracy.
* It is the power to 
  * say "no" to someone else's agenda.
  * keep an issue off the agenda.
  * keep an issue from being decided.
  * keep an issue from being implemented.

---

# Three Types of Political Power

## **Blocking Power** is reflective of our biased system: it is easier to block than to act.
* Some issues are allowed to come to the fore while others are deemed unworthy of consideration.
* Even with an even playing field, there are vastly more powerful teams.

---

# Three Types of Political Power

## **Quiescence or Powerlessness** is the inability to get one's issues on the agenda or to get one's preferred solutions adopted.
* e.g., the poor, the homeless, etc.
* Quiescence is the most common form of powerlessness in a democracy.
* People attempt but fail to influence the policy process, so they give up.
* Has lasting generational effects.

# Blocked? Strategies for Inducing Policy Change

## Kindgon's Three Streams and the Window of Opportunity Model

* **Problem Stream**: the collection of problems that the public and policymakers perceive as meriting public attention and governmental action.
* **Policy Stream**: the collection of policy proposals that the public and policymakers perceive as meriting public attention and governmental action.
* **Politics Stream**: the collection of political factors that the public and policymakers perceive as meriting public attention and governmental action.

---

# Blocked? Strategies for Inducing Policy Change

## Kindgon's Three Streams and the Window of Opportunity Model

### These "streams" come together at an opportune moment when attention is high or negative, creating a window of opportunity for policy change.

* **Window of Opportunity**: the convergence of the problem stream, the policy stream, and the politics stream.
* **Policy Entrepreneurs**: individuals who are able to take advantage of the window of opportunity to push their preferred solutions.

---

# Blocked? Strategies for Inducing Policy Change

## Sabatier's Advocacy Coalition Framework

* **Advocacy Coalition**: a collection of individuals and groups who share a common set of policy beliefs and who seek to influence policymakers.
* Because of elites and policy monopolies, groups often come together to advance policy preferences (i.e., strength in numbers)

---

# Blocked? Strategies for Inducing Policy Change

## Sabatier's Advocacy Coalition Framework

### Coalitions come together based on similar beliefs and values.
* **Policy Beliefs**: the fundamental beliefs that define the policy preferences of an advocacy coalition.
* **Policy Core Beliefs** are often based on deeply held values and beliefs.

#### Coalitions venue shop to find the best place to advance their policy preferences.

# The Policy Agenda Recap

* Problems are socially constructed.
* Groups compete to define problems and solutions.
* The agenda is the list of things being discussed and sometimes acted upon by a political body, the news media, or the public at large.
* Agenda setting is the process by which problems and alternative solutions gain or lose public and elite attention.
* Political power is the ability to get things done in a political system.
* There are three types of political power: coercive power, blocking power, and quiescence or powerlessness.
* We discussed two models for inducing policy change: Kingdon's three streams and the window of opportunity model and Sabatier's advocacy coalition framework.
