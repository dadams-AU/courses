# Outputs and Outcomes

**Outputs**
- The **measurable** things an agency or org. produces
- The effort gov't expends to address problems
- e.g., # of traffic signals installed, # of people served by a program, # of people arrested
- e.g., laws, regulations, programs, services, etc.

**Outcomes**
- The **intended** or **unintended** consequences of gov't action
- The **effect** of gov't action on the problem
- Difficult to measure and hard to quantify
- e.g., reduction in traffic accidents, reduction in crime, reduction in poverty

# Policy Analysis in the Policy Process

- The use of analytic tools, often from operations research, statistics, and economics, in order to assess the consequences of policy alternativesâ€”to predict outcomes from expended outputs.
- Useful to predict how a policy may adapt to new conditions and changing circumstances and interests. 
- It asks, "How does the effort expended _cause_ a particular outcome?"

---

# Causation

- **Causation** is the relationship between cause and effect.
- Conditions for Cause and Effect
  - Cause must precede effect
  - Cause and effect must be related
  - No other factor can explain the relationship


--- 


# Causation

## Positive and Negative Relationships

- **Positive relationship**: the higher the value of one variable, the higher the value of the other variable
- **Negative relationship**: the higher the value of one variable, the lower the value of the other variable
- **No relationship**: the value of one variable does not affect the value of the other variable

# A Brief History of Policy Analysis

- _Muller v. Oregon_ (1908)
  - The liberty protected by Due Process of the Fourteenth Amendment is not a bar to Oregon's compelling interest in protecting women's health through restricted working hours.
  - What does this have to do with policy analysis?

- Empirical knowledge for gov't policy expanded as social science disciplines and law were professionalized in the early 20th century.

- Increase in policy advisors in the 1930s and 1940s and especially after WWII.

# A Brief History of Policy Analysis

## Harold Laswell on the Principles of Policy Science

- Orientation toward problem solving based in theory and empiricism
- Policy sciences are multidisciplinary
- Politics matter because _values matter_
"[In] a democracy, decisions are made in a _political_ system in which values are as important as neutrally derived facts."

---
# A Brief History of Policy Analysis

## A Policy Science

- An applied science
- Deals with major policy issues
- Requires interdisciplinary inquiry
- Empirical and based in sophisticated theory
- Dedicated to improving public policy through improved information and policy discourse

---

# A Brief History of Policy Analysis

- Analysts were in high demand by the time of the Great Society programs of the 1960s.
- Practitioners drew from a wide range of academic disciplines, especially economics.
  - ... for a "rational" way of making policy to overcome the "messiness, contingency, and sometimes irrationality fo politics as a system for defining problems and framing solutions."
- Computers were employed to assist in forecasting and modeling.

# Role of the Policy Analyst

Here is the content formatted as a Markdown table:

|**Analytical Integrity**|**Responsibility to Clients**|**Adherence to One's Concept of Good**|
|-|-|-|  
|**Objective Technician**<br>Let analysis speak for itself. Primary focus should be predicting consequences of alternative policies.|Clients are necessary evils; their political fortunes should be secondary considerations. Keep distance from clients; select institutional clients whenever possible.|Relevant values should be identified but trade-offs among them should be left to clients. Objective advice promotes good in the long run.|
|**Client's Advocate**<br>Analysis rarely produces definitive conclusions. Take advantage of ambiguity to advise clients' positions.|Clients provide analysts with legitimacy. Loyalty should be given in return for access to privileged information and to political processes.|Select clients with compatible value systems; use long-term relationships to change clients' conceptions of good.|
|**Issue Advocate**<br>Analysis rarely produces definitive conclusions. Emphasize ambiguity and excluded values when analysis does not support advocacy.|Clients provide an opportunity for advocacy. Select them opportunistically; change clients to further personal policy agenda.|Analysis should be an instrument for progress towards ones' conception of the good society.|

# Role of the Policy Analyst

# Eugene Bardach's Eightfold Path

1. Define the problem
2. Assemble some evidence
3. Construct the alternatives
4. Select the criteria
5. Project the outcomes
6. Confront the trade-offs
7. Decide
8. Tell your story

# Modern Policy Analysis
## Two Logics of Policy Making
### Economic Rationality of Policy Analysts

- Application of economic logic to political phenomena as a way to bypass the "messiness" of politics
- Transparent assumptions
- Consistent methods to compare alternatives

---

# Modern Policy Analysis
## Two Logics of Policy Making
### Political Rationality of Policy Makers

- Policy makers are not rational actors
- Strategic use of information
- Release favorable information and suppress unfavorable information

---

# Modern Policy Analysis
## Two Logics of Policy Making
### Which is Right? 

- Both are right, but they are not the same
- Policy makers are not rational actors, but they are not irrational either
- Policy makers are not always strategic, but they are not always naive either
- Politics is full of paradoxes and contradictions that are not amenable to economic logic

---

# Modern Policy Analysis
## A Need to Understand the Political Context

- It can explain policy outcomes that might not otherwise make sense
- It can help to design effective democratic institutions or refine existing ones
- Analysts can operate more effectively if they understand the political context

---

# Modern Policy Analysis
# Analysis as a Profession

- The field has evolved over the past 50 years
- The field is now more professionalized and specialized
- The field is more diverse and interdisciplinary
- Technical skills are still essential but no longer the leading motivation driving the field
- Analysts are active participants in the policy process
