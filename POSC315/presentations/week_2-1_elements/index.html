        <section>
          <h2>The Stages Model</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Issue Emergence</strong>: A problem is identified and brought to the attention of government officials and the public.</li>
            <li><strong>Agenda Setting</strong>: The problem is placed on the government agenda for consideration.</li>
            <li><strong>Alternative Selection</strong>: The government considers various policy options to address the problem.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Policy Implementation</strong>: The government implements the policy.</li>
            <li><strong>Policy Evaluation</strong>: The government evaluates the policy to determine its effectiveness.
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Policy Maintenance, Succession, or Termination</strong>: The government decides to maintain, modify, or terminate the policy.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Issue Emergence</strong>: What new issues emerge as the policy is maintained, modified, or terminated?</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Stages Model Strengths</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Intuitive</strong>: The stages model is easy to understand and explain.</li>
            <li><strong>Descriptive</strong>: The stages model describes the policy process in a way that is consistent with how people think about the policy process.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible</strong>: The stages model can be adapted to different policy areas and levels of government.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Stages Model Weaknesses</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Linear</strong>: The stages model assumes that the policy process is linear and sequential.</li>
            <li><strong>Oversimplified</strong>: The stages model oversimplifies the policy process by ignoring the complexity of the policy process.</li>
            <li><strong>Separate</strong>: The stages model separates the policy process into distinct stages, but in reality, the stages overlap and interact with each other.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Systems Thinking</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A way of thinking about natural or social phenomena as a system with various inputs that are processed and intermingle to create a discernible set of outputs.</li>
            <li>A way of thinking about the world that emphasizes the relationships among the parts of a system and how the parts interact with each other and the system as a whole.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>The Systems Model</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Public policy is viewed as the response of the political system to forces brought to bear on it from the outside environment.</li>
            <li>A policy environment surrounds the political system.
              <ul>
                <li>Forces enter the political system from the environment either as demands or as support</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Systems Model</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Policy Environment</strong>: The political, economic, and social context in which the policy is developed and implemented.</li>
            <li><strong>Inputs</strong>: The demands and expectations of the public, interest groups, and government officials.</li>
            <li><strong>Throughputs</strong>: The policy process is the interaction between the policy environment and the political system. This is the “black box” of the policy process.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>The Systems Model</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Outputs</strong>: The policy outputs are the laws, regulations, and decisions that are created by the policy process.</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback</strong>: The feedback is the response to the policy outputs.</li>
            <li><strong>Policy Outcomes</strong>: The policy outcomes are the effects of the policy outputs and feedback.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Systems Model Strengths</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Holistic</strong>: The systems model is holistic because it considers the policy environment, the political system, and the policy process.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic</strong>: The systems model is dynamic because it considers the interaction between the policy environment and the political system.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible</strong>: The systems model can be adapted to different policy areas and levels of government.</li>
          </ul>

        <section>
          <h2>Systems Model Weaknesses</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Complex</strong>: The systems model is complex because it considers the policy environment, the political system, and the policy process.</li>
            <li><strong>Abstract</strong>: The systems model is abstract because it does not provide a clear explanation of the policy process.</li>
