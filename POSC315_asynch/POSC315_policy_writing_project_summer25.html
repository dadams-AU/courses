<p><strong>To:</strong> Director, Bureau of Land Management (BLM)</p>
<p><strong>From:</strong> Jordan Taylor</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> June 21, 2025</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Managing Overpopulation Under the Wild
Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act</p>
<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) faces a growing challenge under
the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971. The current
population of wild horses and burros on public rangelands has exceeded
sustainable levels, leading to ecological degradation and rising
management costs. This memo evaluates three policy alternatives to
address overpopulation and recommends expanding fertility control
programs as the most cost-effective and publicly acceptable
solution.</p>
<h3 id="problem-definition">Problem Definition</h3>
<p>The Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act (1971) mandates the
protection of wild horses and burros as “living symbols of the historic
and pioneer spirit of the West.” However, current herd sizes far exceed
the Appropriate Management Levels (AML) established by BLM scientists,
leading to significant environmental, fiscal, and policy challenges.</p>
<p>Research has shown that unmanaged horse populations can cause
long-term damage to arid ecosystems, particularly by overgrazing native
plant species and compacting soil near riparian zones (Beever and
Brussard 2000). This contributes to biodiversity loss and alters natural
fire regimes. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (2021) also
reported that the cost of maintaining off-range holding facilities has
escalated to unsustainable levels, now comprising the majority of the
Wild Horse and Burro Program budget.</p>
<p>Stakeholders affected include environmental groups concerned with
ecosystem health, ranchers who lease public lands for grazing, animal
welfare advocates demanding humane treatment, and federal agencies
balancing ecological stewardship with legal mandates. The issue is
politically contentious, shaped by diverging values and regional
economic interests (Nie 2003).</p>
<p>Given the increasing financial burden and ecological risks, the
status quo is widely viewed as untenable. Addressing this challenge
requires a nuanced understanding of both ecological science and public
policy—grounded in evidence and sensitive to public opinion and
political feasibility.</p>
<h3 id="policy-alternatives">Policy Alternatives</h3>
<p>Building on ecological and fiscal concerns, this section evaluates
three primary strategies that have been considered in the policy
literature (Garrott and Oli 2013; Rutberg et al. 2017).</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Increased Roundups</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Pros:</em> Provides immediate relief to overgrazed rangelands.
Historically used and logistically feasible with existing
infrastructure.</li>
<li><em>Cons:</em> Extremely costly over time due to long-term holding;
public outcry over animal welfare; does not address root cause of
overpopulation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Fertility Control Programs (e.g., PZP
Vaccine)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Pros:</em> Evidence-based and endorsed by wildlife biologists;
cost-effective long-term strategy; high public approval; aligns with
humane treatment goals (Turner et al. 2002).</li>
<li><em>Cons:</em> Requires sustained funding and logistical
coordination; biological efficacy depends on repeated application.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Adoption Incentives</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Pros:</em> Promotes public engagement and reduces herd size
through private ownership; supported by animal welfare
organizations.</li>
<li><em>Cons:</em> Historically limited impact; low demand for adoption;
potential welfare issues if adopted animals are not properly cared
for.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>These alternatives are evaluated in the matrix above, drawing on
feasibility, cost, equity, public support, and implementation
complexity.</p>
<h3 id="recommendation">Recommendation</h3>
<p>I recommend expanding fertility control programs using the PZP
vaccine. This approach addresses the root cause of overpopulation
humanely and cost-effectively. Although results are gradual, this policy
aligns with public sentiment, reduces long-term management costs, and
mitigates environmental degradation.</p>
<p>Implementation should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased funding for field application teams.</li>
<li>Public education campaigns to build support.</li>
<li>Annual monitoring to track program effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Without immediate policy adjustments, overpopulation will continue to
strain federal budgets and damage public rangelands. Fertility control
programs provide a sustainable and publicly acceptable solution that
fulfills the BLM’s obligations under the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and
Burros Act.</p>
