# Policy Design and Tools

## Part 3: Policy Tools and Implementation

---

## Policy Tools

**Definition:** The means by which the policy will achieve its goals

### Key Characteristics

- How government seeks a policy objective
- The interface between the government's intentions and actual implementation outcomes
- Range from direct provision to market incentives to regulations

**The selection of appropriate policy tools is crucial for successful implementation**

---

## Policy Tool Typology

### Schneider & Ingram (1990)

**Four Categories of Tools:**

1. **Authority tools:** Rules backed by sanctions (e.g., mandates)
2. **Incentive tools:** Rewards or penalties (e.g., taxes, subsidies)
3. **Capacity tools:** Build ability to comply (e.g., training, funding)
4. **Symbolic tools:** Signal intent or values (e.g., proclamations)

**Most policies use a mix of tools, each reflecting assumptions about how people behave**

---

## Dimensions of Policy Tools

| **Dimension**        | **Options/Examples**                        |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Type of Activity** | Money (grants, payments); Services, protections, restrictions |
| **Delivery System**  | Direct (government); Indirect (nonprofits, contractors) |
| **Centralization**   | Federal; State; Shared                      |
| **Complexity**       | Simple; Layered or customized                |

**Effective tools match the problem's nature, target population, and administrative context**

---

## Love, Fear, and Money

### Etzioni (1961)

**Three basic reasons why people comply with rules, orders, or policy:**

1. **Love:** Compliance out of a sense of agreement, love, or moral obligation
2. **Fear:** Compliance out of a sense of fear of punishment
3. **Money:** Compliance is in one's monetary or remunerative interest

**Effective policies find a balance between low levels of fear and high levels of love and money**

*Source: Etzioni, A. (1961). A Comparative Analysis of Complex Organizations*

## Love, Fear, and Money: Applications

### Policy Examples

- **Love:** Public campaigns appealing to moral duty (e.g., recycling, blood donation)
- **Fear:** Enforcement through traffic fines, criminal penalties, business regulations
- **Money:** Use of tax incentives, subsidies, grants, or direct economic benefits

---

## Love, Fear, and Money: Trade-offs

- **Fear-based tools** can prompt immediate compliance but may foster resistance or resentment
- **Love-based tools** encourage sustainable behavior change but require time and cultural alignment
- **Money-based tools** are often effective but can be costly and risk creating dependency

**Selecting the right compliance mechanism depends on the policy domain and context**

---

## Balancing Compliance Mechanisms

**Policy designers must consider:**

- Cultural context - what motivates the target population?
- Time horizon - immediate compliance vs. long-term sustainability
- Resource constraints - economic tools require budgets
- Political feasibility - coercive tools face more resistance
- Administrative capacity - can the implementing agency enforce?

**The most effective policies typically employ a mix of all three mechanisms tailored to context and goals**

---

## Policy Tool Considerations

### Key Principles

- Non-Coercive to coercive (love to fear) exist along a continuum
- The extent to which government will use its resources to achieve a policy goal
- Choosing effective tools requires a good causal theory

---

## Policy Tool Considerations

### Questions to Ask

- What behavior needs to change?
- Who needs to take action?
- What might motivate compliance?
- What tools are politically feasible?

---

## Policy Tool Considerations

### Tool Selection Criteria

- Effectiveness
- Efficiency
- Equity
- Enforceability
- Political acceptability

---

## Models of Policy Tools

### Howlett, Ramesh, and Perl

**Policy tools represent the specific instruments governments use to implement policies and achieve policy goals.**

**They range from direct service provision to market incentives to regulations.**

**The choice of tools reflects both technical considerations and political values**

*Source: Howlett, M., Ramesh, M., & Perl, A. (2009). Studying Public Policy: Policy Cycles and Policy Subsystems*

---

## Economic Tools Characteristics

- Favor individual freedom and choice
- Tend to use non-coercive means
- Makes many assumptions about what is "possible" and what is "rational"
- Assumes that people are rational actors

---

## Economic Tools Examples

- **Subsidies:** Agriculture, energy, housing
- **Tax incentives:** R&D credits, mortgage deductions
- **Vouchers:** Education, housing, healthcare
- **User fees:** Parks, highways, utilities
- **Market creation:** Cap and trade systems

---

## Economic Tools: Trade-offs

### Advantages

- Preserve individual choice and market mechanisms
- Often more politically palatable than regulations
- Can harness market efficiency for public goals
- Allow flexible responses by target populations

---

## Economic Tools: Trade-offs

### Disadvantages

- May not work when markets are imperfect
- Can be captured by special interests
- Benefits may be unequally distributed
- Effectiveness depends on accurate pricing
- May have unintended consequences

**Economic tools work best when markets function well and policy goals align with individual self-interest**

---

## Political Tools

> "Any instrument [or tool] can theoretically accomplish any chosen aim, but governments prefer less coercive instruments unless forced by either recalcitrance on the part of the subject and/or continued social pressure for change to utilize more coercive instruments."
>
> *- Howlett, Ramesh, and Perl*

---

### Political Tool Examples

- **Regulations:** Command-and-control rules
- **Direct provision:** Government services
- **Information:** Public campaigns
- **Public enterprises:** State-owned entities

*Source: Howlett, M., Ramesh, M., & Perl, A. (2009). Studying Public Policy: Policy Cycles and Policy Subsystems*

---

## Tools and Choices

### Key Considerations

- Technically sound design â‰  political viability
- Resources constrain available options
- Behavioral assumptions matter
- Multiple tools typically needed

---

## Tools and Choices

### Tool Selection Factors

- Administrative capacity
- Organizational culture
- Past policy experiences
- Political support/opposition
- Time constraints

**The most successful policies use complementary tools that address different aspects of the problem**

---

## Objective and Subjective Tools

### Objective - Rational Characteristics

- **Target population:** The citizens who receive the benefits or bear the costs of the policy
- **Values:** What is being distributed or promoted
- **Rules:** Guidelines governing or constraining action
- **Rationales:** The justification for the policy
- **Assumptions:** Behavioral theories that tie all of these together

**These represent the technical elements of policy design - the "mechanics" of how policies function**

---

## Subjective - Value Characteristics

### Key Questions

- Who justifiably deserves the costs and benefits of the policy?
- What values should be backed by the coercive powers of the state?
- Who (or what) should have the freedom of action promoted or constrained to uphold those values?

**These represent the normative and political dimensions of policy design**

---

## Objective and Subjective Elements: Interplay

### Climate Policy Example

| **Objective Elements**                | **Subjective Elements**                      |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Carbon pricing mechanisms              | Intergenerational justice concerns           |
| Emissions targets and timelines        | Distribution of transition costs             |
| Reporting requirements                 | Rights of affected communities               |
| Enforcement structures                 | Balance between global and local interests   |

**Effective policy design requires attention to both dimensions**

---

## Integrating Policy Design Elements

### Key Principles

- Goals must be clearly articulated but may require flexibility
- Causal theories should be evidence-based but acknowledge uncertainties
- Tools should match both the technical aspects of the problem and reflect societal values
- Target populations must be precisely defined while considering equity implications
- Implementation plans need to address both administrative capacity and political sustainability

**The art of policy design lies in synthesizing technical expertise with democratic values**

---

## Policy Design in Practice

| **Challenges**              | **Strategies**                    |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Incomplete information      | Pilot programs                    |
| Value conflicts             | Inclusive design processes         |
| Resource constraints        | Phased implementation             |
| Political pressures         | Evidence-based approaches          |
| Implementation complexities | Adaptive management                |

**Policy design is iterative, not linear - it requires ongoing learning and adaptation**
