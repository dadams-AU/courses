# Implementation

## POSC 315 • Introduction to Public Policy - Part 1

*Transforming Policy into Practice*

---

## Today's Agenda (Part 1)

- **Learning Objectives**
- **Why Implementation Matters**
- 1st Generation: Case Study Foundations
- 2nd Generation: Theory Building
- Case Study: National Speed Limit

---

## Learning Objectives

**By the end of this session, you will be able to:**

- **Explain** why implementation is critical in the policy cycle
- **Differentiate** among generations of implementation scholarship
- **Analyze** real-world examples of policy rollout successes and failures
- **Identify** strategies to improve implementation outcomes

---

## Why Implementation Matters

### The Reality Gap

- **Policy → Action gap:** legislation alone doesn't change outcomes
- **Frontline discretion** shapes how rules affect communities
- **Opportunity** for stakeholder influence & conflict

Implementation is where policy meets reality.

---

## 1st Generation: Case Study Foundations

### Period: 1960s–70s

**Key Works:**

- Derthick's *New Towns in Town*
- Pressman & Wildavsky's *Implementation*

**Focus:** Understanding why programs fail

---

## 1st Generation Lessons

### Key Discoveries

- **Executive commitment** is vital
- **Design must reflect** local needs & capacity
- **Joint action complexity** across agencies creates challenges

These early studies revealed implementation as a distinct field of study.

---

## 2nd Generation: Theory Building

### Period: 1980s–90s

**Characteristics:**

- Rise of **top-down & bottom-up** models
- Sought **unified theory**
- Over-relied on rationality assumptions

---

## Top-Down Models

### Approach

- **Hierarchical control** → clear goals
- Emphasis on central authority and compliance

### Trade-offs

- **Pros:** Accountability, clear authority
- **Cons:** Ignores frontline realities, federalism

---

## Bottom-Up Models

### Approach

- Begins with **street-level implementers** and target groups
- Uses **Backward Mapping** from desired outcomes

### Trade-offs

- **Pros:** Local adaptation, discretion
- **Cons:** Variable outcomes, power imbalances

---

## Case Study: National Speed Limit (1974–95)

### The Policy

- **Federal mandate:** 55 mph to save fuel & improve safety
- **States implemented** to avoid funding loss
- **Outcomes varied** across states
- **Repealed** amid differing local priorities

---

## Reflection Questions

1. What made the speed limit policy difficult to implement uniformly?
2. How did federal-state relationships affect outcomes?
3. What does this case teach us about top-down vs. bottom-up approaches?

---

## Part 1 Summary

**Key Points:**

- Implementation emerged as distinct field in 1960s-70s
- Early case studies revealed complexity of joint action
- 2nd generation developed competing theoretical models
- Top-down vs. bottom-up debate shaped the field

---

## Next: Part 2 - Modern Implementation Theory

**Coming up:**

- 3rd Generation: Networks & Dialogue
- 4th Generation: Program Focus
- Best Practices & Common Pitfalls
- Practical Applications
