# Policy Failure and Learning

## Part 1

*Understanding Failure*

---

## Implementation Review

**Key Reminders:**

- Policy implementation is very complex
- Policy isn't self-executing
- Policy design to improve implementation is challenging
- **Bureaucrats have discretion**

*This sets the stage for understanding why policies fail*

---

## Is Implementation Technical or Political?

### The Old Idea

- Administration simply does the will of the legislature
- *(Wilson [1887], Goodnow [1900])*

### The New Idea

- Administration is a **political process**
- Implementation is inherently political
- *(Appleby [1949], Waldo [1948], Pressman & Wildavsky [1973])*

---

## Who is Responsible for Implementation?

**Consider these actors:**

- The legislature?
- The executive?
- The bureaucracy?
- The courts?
- The public?
- **All of the above?**

*Shared responsibility complicates accountability*

## Implementation Studies: Four Generations

1. **First Generation:** The "Classics" *(1930s-1950s)*
2. **Second Generation:** The "Moderns" *(1960s-1970s)*
3. **Third Generation:** The "Post-Moderns" *(1980s-1990s)*
4. **Fourth Generation:** The "New New" *(2000s)*

## Policy Failure

### Why some policies might not work

Understanding failure is essential for improvement

---

## Possible Reasons for Policy Failure (1)

**Behavioral and Goal Issues:**

- People may **respond or adapt** to policies in ways that negate their influence
- Policies may have **incompatible goals** that conflict with one another
- Solutions may involve **costs and consequences** greater than people will accept

---

## Possible Reasons for Policy Failure (2)

**Resource and Implementation Issues:**

- **Inadequate resources** allocated for implementation
- Policies may be **watered down** during administration
- Policies may address only **one or few factors** of multi-causal problems

---

## Possible Reasons for Policy Failure (3)

**Complexity and Context Issues:**

- Many problems **cannot be solved completely**
- **New problems** may distract attention
- **Federal policies** implemented by state/local agencies face coordination challenges

---

## Responses to Policy Failure

**When policies fail, governments may:**

- Adjust enforcement methods
- Allocate more money or resources
- Face legal/constitutional challenges
- **Ignore the policy** (benign neglect)
- **Delegate to local governments**
- **Abandon or repeal** the policy

---

## Policy Failure: A Slippery Concept

**Why is failure hard to define?**

- Success and failure are subjective
- Multiple stakeholders have different criteria
- Timing matters for assessment
- Context shapes interpretation

---

## Two Types of Failure

### 1. Theoretical Failure

- **The causal theory** didn't work as predicted
- Wrong understanding of cause-effect relationships

### 2. Programmatic Failure  

- **Implementation** didn't work as planned
- Good theory, poor execution

---

## Failure is in the Eye of the Beholder

**Critical Questions:**

- **When** did it fail?
- **Who** did it fail?
- **Where** did it fail?
- **How** did it fail?

*Each question may yield different answers*

---

## Part 1 Summary

**Key Points:**

- Implementation is inherently political, not just technical
- Policy failure has multiple causes and types
- Failure is subjective and context-dependent
- Understanding failure patterns helps improve policy design

---

## Next: Part 2 - Learning from Failure

**Coming up:**

- Challenges in defining failure
- Learning from policy failures
- Types of policy-oriented learning
- Moving from failure to success
