# Policy Failure and Learning

## Part 2

*From Failure to Learning to Success*

---

## Failure is Challenging to Define

**Why the complexity?**

- Some policies are **tentative first steps** toward broader solutions
- **Doing something** shows the system responds to problems
- Would the **"do nothing" option** have been better?

*Perfect shouldn't be the enemy of good*

---

## Excessive Policy Demand

**The Problem:**

- Constant demands for government to do "something"
- Makes failures more inevitable as complexity increases
- Government may claim to have resources/tools for **technically infeasible** policies

**Result:** Unrealistic expectations lead to perceived failures

---

## Reasonable Expectations

**Key Questions:**

- Do we reach too far in expecting government can solve problems?
- If we make **progress**, is that failure even if we don't meet exact goals?

*Setting realistic expectations is crucial for fair evaluation*

---

## Poor Causal Theory

**The Failure Chain:**

- **Theory** influences tool choice
- **Tool choice** influences implementation  
- **Implementation** influences outcomes

*Weak links anywhere in the chain can cause policy failure*

---

## Learning from Failure

**The Opportunity:**

- Failure provides valuable information
- Learning can lead to policy improvement
- Systematic analysis helps avoid repeating mistakes

---

## Policy Failure and Learning

**Learning as:**

- A path to **policy change**
- **Accumulating information** for better decision making
- A **process of discovery** and key to evaluation

*Learning transforms failure into opportunity*

---

## Two Types of Learning

### 1. Single-Loop Learning

- **Correcting errors** in implementation without questioning the policy
- Learn about **performance**
- Learn how **process or tools** may have failed
- **Adjust** by changing process or tools

---

## Two Types of Learning

### 2. Double-Loop Learning  

- **Questioning the policy itself** and underlying assumptions
- Learn from single-loop learning
- **Rethink fundamental assumptions** about the problem
- Learn about inherent **values, goals, and assumptions**

---

## An Urge to Learn

### Why We Want to Learn

1. **Improve Performance**
   - Internally, within organizations

2. **Normative Expectations**
   - We believe government and policymakers should learn
   - We institutionalize learning through evaluation, after-action reports

---

## Three Types of Policy-Oriented Learning (1)

### 1. Instrumental Learning

- Learning about the **best means** to achieve a given end
- Focus on efficiency and effectiveness

### 2. Social Learning

- Learning about the **values and goals** that underlie policy
- Examine the **social construction** of the problem
- Determine if approach worked in specific environment

---

## Three Types of Policy-Oriented Learning (2)

### 3. Political Learning

- Learning about the **political environment** and how to navigate it
- Learning about the **political feasibility** of policy
- Focus on how to make **more effective arguments** for policy

---

## The Goal of Learning

# **SUCCESS!**

*Learning transforms failure into future success*

---

## Key Takeaways

**Remember:**

- Failure is complex and subjective
- Multiple types of learning are possible
- **Single-loop** vs. **double-loop** learning serve different purposes
- **Instrumental**, **social**, and **political** learning address different aspects
- The ultimate goal is policy improvement

## Reflection Questions

1. Can you think of a policy that failed but led to important learning?
2. Which type of learning (single/double-loop) is more common in government?
3. How can we better institutionalize learning from failure?
