# Evaluation & Systems Thinking

### POSC 315 — Lecture 13.1

---

## What Is Policy Evaluation?

* **Evaluation**: systematic inquiry into a public program’s merit, worth, or significance.
* Core aim → determine whether observed changes can credibly be attributed to the policy, not to chance or outside shocks.
* It’s research in service of *learning*, *accountability*, and *improvement*.

---

## The Big Question

> **Did the program generate a *significant* and *positive* impact on its target population that would *not* have occurred otherwise?**

*Requires counterfactual thinking — what would the world look like in the program’s absence?*

---

## Why It Matters — Stakeholders

* **Taxpayers:** want value for money.
* **Program Beneficiaries:** care about real outcomes.
* **Program Managers:** need feedback to refine operations.
* **Elected Officials:** must justify budgets and defend choices.
* **Analysts & Scholars:** build evidence and theory.

## Evaluation Designs — Overview

We choose a design based on data, ethics, and practicality.

1. **Before‑and‑After**
2. **After‑Only**
3. **With‑and‑Without (Quasi‑Experiment)**
4. **Time‑Series**

---

### Before‑and‑After

* Observe outcome **O₀** pre‑program.
* Implement policy.
* Observe outcome **O₁** post‑program.
* Attribute Δ = O₁ – O₀ to policy **if** rival explanations ruled out (rare in practice).

---

### After‑Only

* Snap‑shot post‑implementation; no baseline.
* Cheap, fast, but *weakest inference*.

---

### With‑and‑Without

* **Treatment** vs **Control** groups.
* Approximates counterfactual when random assignment isn’t feasible.
* Methods: matching, difference‑in‑differences, synthetic controls.

---

### Time‑Series

* Long string of observations before *and* after policy.
* Detects trends, seasonality, structural breaks.
* Gold standard when randomization impossible and data rich (e.g., crime rates after ban).

## Quick Design Comparison

| Design       | Strength                | Key Limitation          |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Before‑After | Simple                  | Confounding trends      |
| After‑Only   | Low cost                | No baseline             |
| With‑Without | Strong causal claim     | Need comparable control |
| Time‑Series  | Detects gradual effects | Data intensive          |

---

## Takeaways for Practitioners

* Pick the **strongest feasible design** given constraints.
* Plan evaluation **before** rollout; retrofit = expensive.
* Combine quantitative + qualitative evidence to capture mechanism.
