# Evaluation Questions & Philosophy of Science

### POSC 315 — Lecture 13.2

---

## Foundational Evaluation Questions

1. **Need:** Does a social gap justify intervention?
2. **Evaluability:** Are goals clear and data collectible?
3. **Process:** How is the program actually operating?
4. **Impact:** What difference does it make?
5. **Efficiency & Equity:** At what cost and for whom?

---

## Going Deeper

1. Was *this* really the problem?
2. Design–problem alignment?
3. Fidelity: Was implementation true to design?
4. Missing data or blind spots?
5. Alternative models worth testing?
6. Concrete next steps for improvement?

## Enter Science: How Do We Know?

*Policy analysis borrows its rigor from the broader scientific enterprise.*

**Science** → systematic, evidence‑seeking process aimed at explanation and prediction.

---

## The Scientific Method (In a Policy Key)

1. **Observe** a social condition (e.g., opioid overdoses rising).
2. **Theory**: Hypothesize mechanisms (pill mills → addiction).
3. **Deduce** testable propositions (closing mills ↓ overdoses).
4. **Collect** data (county‑level death certificates).
5. **Analyze** (difference‑in‑diff).
6. **Conclude & Revise**.

## Philosophy of Science — Why Bother?

*Underpins the credibility of our evidence claims.*

* What counts as *reality*? (Metaphysics)
* How can we *know* it? (Epistemology)
* Why should we *value* certain outcomes? (Axiology)

---

## Metaphysics (Reality Check)

* Is poverty a structural inevitability or policy choice?
* Ontological stance shapes causal stories.

---

## Epistemology (Knowledge Claims)

* **Rationalism:** Reason can unveil policy truths (e.g., welfare calculus).
* **Empiricism:** Evidence rules (randomized evaluation of housing vouchers).
* **Skepticism:** Stay humble — data are theory‑laden.

---

## Axiology (Values in the Room)

* Efficiency vs Equity trade‑offs.
* Transparency, accountability, social justice.
* Your *implicit* values steer research questions.

# Bridge to Next Deck

*Methodological worldviews (positivism, constructivism, etc.) and why they matter for crafting policy evidence.*
