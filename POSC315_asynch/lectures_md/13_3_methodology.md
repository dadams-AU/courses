# Methodological Approaches & Policy Relevance

### POSC 315 — Lecture 13.3

## Competing Worldviews

| Perspective                 | Knowledge Claim               | Policy Example                            |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Positivism**              | Objective laws discoverable   | EPA emissions standard modeling           |
| **Post‑Positivism**         | Objective-ish but uncertain   | CBO dynamic scoring with confidence bands |
| **Constructivism**          | Reality socially constructed  | Community narratives in urban planning    |
| **Critical Theory**         | Knowledge entwined with power | Disparate impact of voter ID laws         |
| **Symbolic Interactionism** | Meaning arises in interaction | "Defund the police" framing battles       |

### Positivism — The Lab Coat Ideal

* Detached observer; value‑free inquiry.
* Hypotheses verified through *replicable* tests.
* Strong suit: regulatory cost‑benefit analysis.

---

### Post‑Positivism — The Fallible Scientist

* Recognizes measurement error, model uncertainty.
* Emphasizes **falsification** (Popper) & **paradigm shifts** (Kuhn).
* Mixed‑methods, triangulation.

---

### Constructivism — The Sense‑Maker

* Multiple legitimate realities.
* Methods: interviews, focus groups, participatory action research.
* Useful when policy success depends on *perceived* legitimacy (e.g., restorative justice).

---

### Critical Theory — The Agitator

* Uncovers hidden power structures.
* Seeks emancipation (e.g., environmental justice mapping).
* Researcher is morally engaged.

---

### Symbolic Interactionism — The Micro Lens

* Policy meanings negotiated at street level (Lipsky’s *street‑level bureaucrats*).
* Ethnography, discourse analysis.

## So What? Linking Methods to Policy

*Choice of paradigm changes the questions you ask and the evidence decision‑makers see.*

| Policy Stage       | Positivist Tool   | Constructivist Tool      |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Problem Definition | Trend analysis    | Community storytelling   |
| Policy Formulation | Forecast models   | Deliberative forums      |
| Implementation     | Logic models      | Co‑production workshops  |
| Evaluation         | Quasi‑experiments | Participatory evaluation |

## Public Policy as Collective Puzzlement

> “Policymaking is *collective puzzlement on society’s behalf*.” — **Hugh Heclo**

* Multiple paradigms = multiple lenses on the puzzle.
* Democratic governance *needs* that pluralism.

---

## Problem Definition Shapes Solutions

> “Whosoever initially identifies a social problem shapes the terms of debate.” — **James A. Jones**

*Data + Frame* → Agenda → Alternatives → Outcomes.

---

## Final Thoughts

* Be explicit about your **assumptions**.
* Match **methods to questions** and **values to context**.
* Good policy science is rigorous *and* reflexive.
