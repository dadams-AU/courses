# Actor Interaction & Agenda Change

### POSC 315 — Lecture 13.4

---

## Policy Actors – The Cast

* **Government officials:** elected + bureaucratic.
* **Organized interests:** firms, unions, NGOs.
* **Epistemic communities:** scientists, policy analysts.
* **Mass public & media:** shape narratives.

> *Policy change is relational: who talks to whom with what resources?*

---

## Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) — 30‑Second Version

* Policy subsystem = turf where actors contest ideas.
* Coalitions share **deep‑core** and **policy‑core** beliefs.
* Change arises via *learning*, *external shocks*, or *negotiated agreements*.

### Mini‑Case: U.S. Climate Policy

* **Pro‑mitigation coalition:** NGOs, clean‑tech firms, youth activists.
* **Economic‑growth coalition:** fossil industries, some labor, growth‑first think tanks.
* Paris targets emerge from shifting coalition balance + external shocks (extreme weather).

## Incrementalism vs Punctuated Equilibrium

| Feature | Incrementalism             | PET                           |
| ------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Tempo   | Slow, continuous           | Long stability + sudden jumps |
| Driver  | Bounded rationality        | Agenda disruption events      |
| Example | Gradual minimum‑wage hikes | 2008 crisis → Dodd‑Frank      |

*Both theories fit within a post‑positivist lens acknowledging cognitive limits and institutional friction.*

---

## Kingdon’s Three Streams Model

* **Problem:** indicators + focusing events.
* **Policy:** ideas floating in the “primeval soup.”
* **Politics:** elections, mood, interest mobilization.
* **Policy window** opens when streams couple → *entrepreneurs* push solutions.

### Quick Application: Telehealth (2020)

* Pandemic = focusing event.
* Mature tech proposals ready.
* Bipartisan politics.
  → CMS waivers become permanent coverage.

## Connecting Back to Policy Science Paradigms

| Framework          | Paradigm Fit                 | Why It Matters                                     |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **ACF**            | Post‑positivist              | Belief‑driven learning; falsifiable sub‑hypotheses |
| **Incrementalism** | Constructivist               | Muddling framed by subjective satisficing          |
| **PET**            | Critical/positivist hybrid   | Power monopolies & attention cycles                |
| **Kingdon**        | Symbolic interactionist edge | Meaningful coupling of ideas & politics            |

*Selecting a framework implies epistemological commitments and shapes the data you seek.*

---

## Synthesis – No One‑Size Theory

* Use **ACF** to map coalitions, **PET** to predict shocks, **Incrementalism** to forecast small tweaks, **Kingdon** to spot windows.
* Blend frameworks for richer explanations — methodological *pluralism* again.

---

## Wrap‑Up

* Actor interactions translate values and evidence into policy action.
* Understanding competing theories helps you **diagnose** stagnation and **strategize** change.

# Discussion Prompts

1. Which framework best captures the evolution of your memo topic this semester?
2. Can you identify an upcoming *policy window* in the news cycle? What stream is missing?
3. How might critical‑theory insights refine an ACF map of climate policy?

# The End — Thanks!

Stay curious, stay critical, and keep puzzling productively.
