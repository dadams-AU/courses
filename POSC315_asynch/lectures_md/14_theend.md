## Where We Started

* Orientation & **policy process overview**
* Constitutional foundations + federalism
* Official & unofficial actors
* Agenda setting and policy types
* Decision‑making, design, implementation
* Failure → learning → **science of policy**

---

## Your Analyst Toolkit

* 🔍 **Problem framing** & agenda diagnostics
* ⚖️ **Criteria design** & trade‑off mapping
* 🛠️ **Alternatives matrix** & evidence synthesis
* 📊 **Evaluation design** — before/after, DiD, time‑series
* 🖋️ **Policy memo writing** with executive punch

## Big Ideas to Keep

1. **Policy ≠ politics, but never politics‑free.**
2. **Evidence is constructed** within paradigms — be reflexive.
3. **Small tweaks dominate**… until a punctuation hits.
4. **Coalitions matter**; relationships are the currency of change.
5. **Learning cycles** turn failure into adaptive capacity.

## Last Deliverables (Due Fri 6 / 27 @ 11:59 PM)

* 📝 **Final Policy Memo** (5–7 pp, Track Changes on)
* 🤔 **1‑2 pp Reflection** — what you learned & what’s next
* 📚 **Reading Quiz 5** closes **Friday** night

Thanks for puzzling with me this summer. Keep questioning, keep building, and, above all, keep serving the public.
