---

- Proposes and shapes the budget
- Reviews regulations

---

**Scope and Scale**

- 2,000–3,000 political appointees
- 15+ Cabinet departments

# The Bureaucracy

---

## Bureaucracy: Implementation Role

1. **Policy Implementation:** Turns laws into programs
2. **Regulation Development:** Writes rules to operationalize goals
3. **Program Administration:** Manages resources and operations
4. **Service Delivery:** Provides direct services to citizens

---

## Bureaucratic Structure

- **Hierarchical Organization:** Chain of command, divisions, formal communication
- **Personnel Systems:** Merit hiring, civil service protections, professional development, performance evaluation

<div class="info-box">
  Bureaucracy balances democratic accountability with technical expertise and efficiency.
</div>

## Street-Level Bureaucrats: Who Are They?

> “The decisions of street-level bureaucrats, the routines they establish, and the devices they invent to cope with uncertainties and work pressures, effectively become the public policies they carry out.”  
> —Michael Lipsky

**Who are street-level bureaucrats?**

- Police officers (exercise discretion in enforcement)
- Teachers (make classroom-level decisions)
- Social workers (manage individual cases)
- DMV clerks, public health nurses, housing inspectors, and more

---

## Street-Level Bureaucrats: Roles & Challenges

**Key characteristics:**

- Direct, daily interaction with the public
- Significant discretionary authority in applying rules
- Operate under resource and time constraints
- Face high-demand, high-pressure environments
- Rely on professional judgment to resolve ambiguity

<div class="highlight-box">
    The choices and routines of street-level bureaucrats shape how policies are experienced by citizens—often determining real-world outcomes.
</div>

---

## Bureaucratic Power: Expertise & Authority

**Technical Expertise**

- Deep subject-matter knowledge
- Practical insights for policy implementation
- Ability to advise and inform elected officials

**Administrative Authority**

- Writes detailed rules and regulations
- Exercises discretion in enforcement
- Allocates resources and manages programs

---

## Bureaucratic Independence

<div class="warning-box">
    <strong>Why Are Agencies Independent?</strong><br>
    Bureaucratic agencies build power through:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Expertise:</strong> Specialized skills and institutional memory</li>
        <li><strong>External Support:</strong> Relationships with interest groups and the public</li>
        <li><strong>Congressional Alliances:</strong> Budgetary and oversight connections</li>
    </ul>
    Even under executive control, these factors give agencies autonomy and influence.
</div>

# The Judiciary

---

## Judiciary: Constitutional Role

- **Constitutional Interpretation:** Defines constitutional meaning and application
- **Legal Dispute Resolution:** Settles conflicts by legal principles
- **Rights Protection:** Safeguards constitutional and civil rights
- **Government Oversight:** Checks actions of other branches

**Key Facts:**

- 9 Supreme Court justices
- ~80 SCOTUS cases per year
- Judicial review established by *Marbury v. Madison* (1803)

---

## Judicial Powers: Review and Authority

**Judicial Review**

- Interprets the Constitution and statutes
- Reviews actions of Congress, the executive, and agencies
- Sets legal precedent for future cases

<div class="info-box">
    Judicial review is not explicitly stated in the Constitution—it was established by *Marbury v. Madison* (1803).
</div>

---

## Judicial Powers: Jurisdiction

**Jurisdictional Authority**

- **Original Jurisdiction:** Hears cases first (e.g., disputes between states)
- **Appellate Jurisdiction:** Reviews decisions from lower courts
- **Federal Question Cases:** Involves federal law or the Constitution
- **Diversity Cases:** Disputes between parties from different states

---

## Judicial Policy Impact: Direct Effects

- **Constitutional Rulings:** Courts can strike down or uphold laws based on constitutional interpretation.
- **Statutory Interpretation:** Judicial decisions clarify the meaning and application of legislation.
- **Oversight of Agencies:** Courts review agency actions for legality and fairness.
- **Court-Ordered Remedies:** Judges can mandate specific actions or changes to address legal violations.

---

## Judicial Policy Impact: Indirect Influence

- **Agenda Setting:** Court decisions can elevate issues to national prominence.
- **Policy Framing:** Judicial opinions shape how policies are understood and debated.
- **Influencing Other Actors:** Rulings affect the behavior of legislators, executives, and agencies.
- **Legitimacy:** Judicial endorsement or rejection can grant or remove legitimacy from policies.

---

## Judicial Constraints: Institutional Limits

- **Case or Controversy:** Courts only decide actual disputes, not hypothetical questions.
- **Standing:** Parties must show direct, personal harm to bring a case.
- **Stare Decisis:** Courts generally follow established precedent.
- **Passive Role:** Judiciary cannot initiate cases—must wait for issues to be brought before them.

---

## Judicial Constraints: External Factors

- **Implementation Dependence:** Courts rely on the executive and others to enforce decisions.
- **Public Opinion & Legitimacy:** Judicial authority can be shaped by societal acceptance.
- **Jurisdictional Boundaries:** Courts are limited by the scope of their legal authority.

> “The judiciary has neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.”  
> —Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 78

# Policy Process Integration

## How the Branches Interact

- **Checks and Balances:** Each branch oversees and limits the others
- **Interdependence:** Policy responsibilities are shared
- **Feedback Loops:** Actors learn and adapt over time
- **Conflict Resolution:** Both formal and informal mechanisms are used

<div class="info-box">
  All official actors constrain each other—creating a dynamic, adaptive policy system.
</div>

# Case Study: How Environmental Policy Happens

<div class="example-box">
    <strong>Clean Air Act in Action:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Congress:</strong> Passes the law and sets goals.</li>
        <li><strong>President:</strong> Signs, sets priorities, and issues executive orders.</li>
        <li><strong>EPA:</strong> Writes regulations, monitors, and enforces standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Courts:</strong> Interpret the law and resolve disputes.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="centered large-text" style="margin-top:1rem;">
        <em>Environmental policy is shaped by all branches at every step.</em>
