## What Is an Agenda?

- **Agenda:** The list of things being discussed and sometimes acted upon by a political body, the news media, or the public at large.
- Not every issue makes it—most never get close.

---

## Other Ways to Define "Agenda"

1. An **underlying ideological plan** (what someone *really* wants).
2. A **collection of public problems** that come to the attention of the public and officials—includes causes, symbols, solutions.
3. A **concrete list** of bills before a legislature.

---

## Agenda as Shared Beliefs

- A **series of beliefs** about what problems exist and how they should be addressed (government, private, nonprofit, joint action).
- **Hidden agendas:** Distrust in government—“what’s their real goal?”
- **Overt agendas:** The stated goals and policy positions.

---

## The Four Levels of the Agenda

1. **Agenda Universe:** The collection of all possible issues.
2. **Systemic Agenda:** Issues the public, media, and government see as meriting attention/action.
3. **Institutional Agenda:** Issues up for serious consideration by a governmental body.
4. **Decision Agenda:** The (very) short list of issues actually acted upon.

## Visualizing the Four Levels

- Agenda Universe: *Everything imaginable—climate change, Bigfoot, school lunches, asteroid defense.*
- Systemic Agenda: *The stuff on the public radar—news stories, protests, campaign promises.*
- Institutional Agenda: *What’s actually on legislative calendars, agency meetings, city council dockets.*
- Decision Agenda: *What’s up for a vote or final action.*

---

## Gatekeeping and Boundaries

- The **boundary** between Systemic Agenda and Agenda Universe is the result of **gatekeeping** by media, politicians, and other actors.
- What’s “acceptable” for government to act on changes over time.
- Boundaries are **not static**—they shift with culture, events, scandals, or leadership changes.

---

## Agenda Competition: The Hunger Games

- **There are too many possible problems and too many potential solutions.**
- No society or government can address them all.
- **Competition for attention is fierce.**
- *Substantial competition for limited agenda space.*

---

## Defining Problems: Not for the Faint of Heart

- Getting on the agenda means overcoming:
  - Difficulty and complexity
  - **Competition** from other groups (everyone wants a piece)
  - Controversy and outright conflict

---

## Attention as a Resource

- We live in a world of **imperfect and costly information**.
- Those who can **persuade** and use their power to get attention can shape the agenda.
- **Attention bottlenecks:** There’s only so much public/elite focus to go around.

---

## Shifting Attention: Bottlenecks and Priorities

- Major events often shift what gets attention.
- Priorities determine where attention is placed (sometimes overnight).
- The *loudest* or most *symbolically charged* issues rise—others fall away.
