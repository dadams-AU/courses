<span class="subtitle">What’s essential? What should you actually remember?</span>

## Why Does Agenda Setting Matter?

- The agenda is where power and politics meet reality.
- What gets *on* the agenda shapes what government actually does.
- If a problem isn’t recognized, it doesn’t get solved—period.

## Key Takeaways

<div class="key-box">
<ul>
  <li><strong>Problems are made, not found.</strong> How we define a problem shapes its fate.</li>
  <li><strong>Getting on the agenda is half the battle.</strong> Most issues never make it.</li>
  <li><strong>Groups compete fiercely for attention,</strong> using stories, numbers, symbols, and sometimes, raw power.</li>
  <li><strong>Power comes in flavors:</strong> coercion, blocking, and the invisible power of exclusion or quiescence.</li>
  <li><strong>Conflict expansion</strong> is the tool groups use to break through bottlenecks.</li>
  <li><strong>Gatekeepers (media, elites, institutions)</strong> control what’s “acceptable” for public action—but even those boundaries can move.</li>
</ul>

## One Slide Recap

- **Agenda setting is not neutral:** It’s a battleground.
- **Most problems don’t get solved** because they’re never seriously considered.
- **Power is exercised as much by keeping things off the agenda as by putting them on.**
- If you want to change the world, learn how agendas work.

## Discussion Prompts

<div class="prompt-box">
<ul>
  <li>Think of a problem you care about. Has it made it onto the “decision agenda”? Why or why not?</li>
  <li>What groups are competing for attention on your issue? Who has the power to block or promote it?</li>
  <li>Can you identify a “focusing event” that suddenly changed what government paid attention to? What happened next?</li>
  <li>Who are the gatekeepers in your community or in the news? How do they shape what’s considered a “real” issue?</li>
</ul>
</div>

# Next Steps

- Pay attention to how issues rise and fall from the headlines.
- Watch for symbols, stories, and numbers—how are they used to frame problems?
- Don’t assume inaction means people don’t care. Sometimes, it means the problem hasn’t made it past the gatekeepers.
