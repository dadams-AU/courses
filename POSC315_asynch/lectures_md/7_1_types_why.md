# Policy Types and Why They Matter
<span class="subtitle">Distributive & Redistributive Policies</span>

---

## Why Study Policy Types?

- Different policy types involve different actors, conflicts, and outcomes.
- Some are highly visible, others barely register with the public.
- Policy types help explain *who wins, who loses*, and *why*.

---

## What Are Policy Typologies?

- Tools for categorizing and understanding different policies.
- Let us predict what kind of politics will accompany different policies.
- No typology is perfect—policies can change types or fit into multiple categories.

## Distributive Policies

<div class="definition">
<strong>Definition:</strong> Take resources from a broad group and deliver benefits to specific groups or individuals.
</div>

- "Logrolling" or "pork barrel" politics—trading favors.
- Creates “Interest Group Liberalism”: government tries to please many narrow interests.
- Broader public interest often neglected.

---

## Distributive Policies: Features

- Interest groups form to protect and expand these policies.
- Popular with politicians, bureaucrats, media, and public.
- Difficult to change or eliminate once established.
- Resistant to reform efforts.

## Distributive Policies: Examples

<div class="example-box">
<ul>
  <li>Farm subsidies</li>
  <li>Social Security</li>
  <li>Medicare & Medicaid</li>
  <li>Student loans</li>
  <li>Tax breaks for homeowners</li>
  <li>Tax deductions for charitable giving</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Distributive Policies: Equity

### Equality vs. Equity

- *Equality* = everyone gets the same thing.
- *Equity* = distributions that are fair (not necessarily equal).
- U.S. tends to focus on *equal opportunity,* not *equal outcomes*.

---

## Distributive Policies: Three Dimensions of Equity

1. **Recipients:** Who gets the benefits?
2. **Item:** What is being distributed?
3. **Process:** How are distribution decisions made?

## Redistributive Policies

<div class="definition">
<strong>Definition:</strong> Take resources from one clearly identifiable group and give them to another.
</div>

- Affects allocation of wealth, property, rights, or privileges.
- Can work in either direction (rich→poor, poor→rich).
- Not always about money—can be about rights and status.

---

## Redistributive Policies: Examples

<div class="example-box">
<ul>
  <li>Welfare programs</li>
  <li>Food stamps (SNAP)</li>
  <li>Unemployment insurance</li>
  <li>Affirmative action</li>
  <li>Civil rights protections</li>
  <li>Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid</li>
</ul>
</div>

---

## Redistributive Policies: Characteristics

- Highly controversial; usually face public opposition.
- Difficult to enact, change, or eliminate.
- Highly visible and often debated.
- Challenging to reform.
