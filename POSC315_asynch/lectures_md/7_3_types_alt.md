- No single typology can explain the messiness of real-world policy.
- Alternative lenses help us see what standard categories miss.
- Use them for insight, not as a cage.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis (Wilson's Lens)

<div class="definition">
<strong>Definition:</strong> Analyze policies by who pays and who benefitsâ€”are costs and benefits concentrated or diffuse?
</div>

- Groups who expect to bear the cost usually oppose the policy.
