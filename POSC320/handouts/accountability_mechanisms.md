## What is Accountability?

**Accountability = The obligation to answer for one's actions to some higher authority**

### Three Essential Components

1. **Answerability:** Obligation to provide information and explanations
2. **Enforceability:** Consequences for poor performance or misconduct
3. **Controllability:** Ability to direct, influence, or constrain behavior

**Why It Matters:** Democratic government requires that those who exercise power on behalf of the people must answer to the people.
