## 🤖 Why We’re Talking About AI

AI tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, and Perplexity AI are becoming common in education and work. In this class, you’re encouraged to think critically about how to **use them responsibly**, **disclose them transparently**, and **avoid shortcuts that undermine your learning**.

This guide outlines what’s okay, what’s not, and how to stay in the clear.

## ✅ Permitted AI Uses

These tools can be helpful if used ethically and transparently:

| Purpose                 | AI Use Example                                                                 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Brainstorming**       | Use ChatGPT to explore topic angles, identify questions to ask, or structure ideas |
| **Grammar/Clarity**     | Use Grammarly or Quillbot to check sentence flow, spelling, and style           |
| **Summarizing Sources** | Use Perplexity to summarize a long article to help your understanding            |
| **Research Tools**      | Use AI-assisted tools like RefWorks, EndNote, or Elicit to find peer-reviewed sources |

If you use any of these tools, you **must explain how** in a short note (see below).

---

## 🚫 Prohibited Uses

The following are **not allowed** and may result in a zero or academic integrity review:

- Submitting **AI-generated drafts** as your own work  
- Copying full sections from ChatGPT or similar tools without revision  
- Using AI to write Research Logs, analysis sections, or conclusions  
- Failing to disclose when AI tools were used

---

## 📌 Required Disclosure Format

Any time you use an AI tool, include a simple note in your assignment or log:

> *“I used ChatGPT to generate possible problem definitions, but selected and edited one on my own.”*

> *“Perplexity AI helped summarize a Brookings report I read; I used that summary to guide my own notes.”*

> *“Grammarly checked my draft for grammar and tone.”*

These don’t need to be long—but they must be honest and specific.

## 🧠 Original Work Still Matters

AI can’t think for you. **Your grade depends on your analysis, synthesis, and understanding**—not just what you turn in.

Every week I check:

- Whether your writing shows growth over time
- If your tracked changes reflect your process
- If your citations and claims are grounded in real sources

If something seems off—like a sudden style shift or generic, vague text—it will be reviewed. I may ask you to explain your thinking or redo sections if originality is unclear.

---

## 🧾 Citation of AI Sources

If you quote or paraphrase output from an AI tool, cite it like a source:

> *ChatGPT, OpenAI. Response to prompt: “Summarize the federalism challenges of COVID vaccine rollout.” June 30, 2025.*

> *Perplexity AI. Summary of GAO Report #22-105051. Accessed July 3, 2025.*

Use APA-style citations in your reference list or as footnotes.

---

## 💬 Examples

**✔ Acceptable:**

> *Used Grammarly to revise awkward sentences in my executive summary. No significant changes to content.*

> *Used ChatGPT to brainstorm initial headings for my stakeholder analysis, but wrote the section myself.*

> *Perplexity helped me quickly understand a CRS report. I used that to guide my own synthesis.*

**✘ Unacceptable:**

> *Pasted entire section from ChatGPT without revision or citation.*

> *Used AI to rewrite Week 3 without tracked changes showing development.*

> *AI-generated sources or citations that don’t exist.*

## 🧭 Why This Matters

Public administration depends on ethical decision-making and accountability. That starts here. AI can be a useful assistant, but it can’t replace:

- Your professional judgment  
- Your ability to synthesize complex material  
- Your growth as a critical thinker and writer

Be transparent. Think critically. Ask if you’re unsure.
