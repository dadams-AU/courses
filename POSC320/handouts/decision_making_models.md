## Four Models of Public Decision-Making

Public administrators use different decision-making approaches depending on the situation, available information, time constraints, and stakeholder involvement.

---

## üéØ Model 1: Rational Decision-Making

### "The Textbook Approach"

**Core Process:**

1. **Define the problem** clearly and completely
2. **Identify all alternatives** and possible solutions
3. **Evaluate each option** using consistent criteria
4. **Select the best alternative** based on analysis
5. **Implement the decision** systematically
6. **Monitor and evaluate** results for future learning

**Assumptions:**

- Complete information is available
- All alternatives can be identified
- Consequences can be predicted accurately
- Decision-makers are purely objective
- Unlimited time and resources for analysis

### Criminal Justice Examples

**When It Works:**

- **Policy Development:** Creating new use-of-force policies with research, stakeholder input, and pilot testing
- **Major Procurement:** Selecting new case management system with formal RFP process and scoring criteria
- **Facility Planning:** Designing new jail with capacity analysis, cost projections, and architectural review

**Typical Process:**

1. Research best practices and legal requirements
2. Analyze current problems and future needs
3. Develop multiple policy/system options
4. Evaluate options using cost-benefit analysis
5. Select best option based on objective criteria
6. Implement with training and evaluation plan

### When to Use Rational Model

- High-stakes decisions with major long-term consequences
- Complex policy issues requiring thorough analysis
- Sufficient time and resources for comprehensive study
- Technical decisions where expertise is crucial
- Stakeholder consensus needed for legitimacy

### Limitations

- Time-consuming when quick decisions are needed
- Expensive in terms of staff time and resources
- Paralysis by analysis‚Äîperfect can be enemy of good
- Political naivety‚Äîignores real-world constraints
- Information overload can confuse rather than clarify

## ‚ö° Model 2: Bounded Rationality

### "Good Enough" Solutions

**Core Process:**

1. **Simplify the problem** to manageable components
2. **Search for alternatives** until acceptable option found
3. **Apply experience and rules of thumb** for quick evaluation
4. **Choose first "satisficing" solution** that meets minimum criteria
5. **Implement quickly** and adjust as needed
6. **Learn from results** to improve future decisions

**Key Concept:** "Satisficing" - choosing first acceptable solution rather than optimal one

**Herbert Simon's Insight:** Decision-makers have limited time, information, and cognitive capacity

### Criminal Justice Examples

**Emergency Deployment:**

- **Problem:** Multiple calls for service, limited officers available
- **Process:** Use established protocols and experience to deploy quickly
- **Outcome:** Good enough coverage that can be adjusted as situations develop

**Daily Operational Decisions:**

- **Court scheduling:** Fill available slots using standard procedures
- **Patrol assignments:** Use beat assignments and recent activity patterns
- **Case prioritization:** Apply prosecutor guidelines and resource constraints

**Routine Administration:**

- **Budget adjustments:** Make incremental changes based on immediate needs
- **Personnel decisions:** Use established criteria and quick evaluation
- **Equipment purchases:** Select from approved vendors meeting basic requirements

### When to Use Bounded Rationality

- Time pressure requiring quick decisions
- Routine operations with established procedures
- Limited resources for extensive analysis
- Experienced decision-makers who can use judgment effectively
- Situations where "good enough" is adequate

### Advantages

- Speed: decisions made quickly when needed
- Efficiency: uses available information effectively
- Practicality: works within real-world constraints
- Flexibility: can adjust as new information emerges
- Experience-based: leverages professional judgment

## üîÑ Model 3: Incremental Decision-Making

### "Muddling Through" with Small Steps

**Core Process:**

1. **Start with existing policies** as baseline
2. **Consider only small changes** from current practice
3. **Build consensus** through gradual modification
4. **Test changes** on limited scale before full implementation
5. **Adjust and adapt** based on feedback and results
6. **Evolve policy** through series of small improvements

**Charles Lindblom's "Science of Muddling Through":**

- Large changes are politically and practically difficult
- Small changes are safer and more achievable
- Policy emerges through incremental adjustments

### Criminal Justice Examples

**Police Reform:**

- **Traditional approach:** Comprehensive department overhaul
- **Incremental approach:** Gradual policy changes, pilot programs, training improvements
- **Example:** Implementing community policing through neighborhood-by-neighborhood expansion

**Court Modernization:**

- **Traditional approach:** Complete system replacement
- **Incremental approach:** Phase in electronic filing, add online services gradually
- **Example:** Starting with traffic cases before moving to criminal cases

**Corrections Improvement:**

- **Traditional approach:** Wholesale program replacement
- **Incremental approach:** Add new programs while maintaining existing ones
- **Example:** Gradually expanding drug treatment from one housing unit to entire facility

### When to Use Incremental Model

- Political sensitivity requiring consensus building
- High uncertainty about outcomes of major changes
- Limited resources for comprehensive reform
- Risk aversion when failure would be costly
- Stakeholder resistance to dramatic change

### Benefits

- Politically feasible: easier to build support
- Lower risk: small changes have limited negative impact
- Learning opportunity: can adjust based on experience
- Builds momentum: success creates support for further change
- Preserves stability while allowing improvement

### Drawbacks

- Slow progress may not address urgent problems
- Status quo bias: difficult to make necessary major changes
- May perpetuate problems rather than solving them
- Crisis vulnerability: incremental change may not prevent disasters

## üóëÔ∏è Model 4: Garbage Can Decision-Making

### "Organized Anarchy" in Crisis Situations

**Core Concept:**
Decision-making in chaotic environments where:

- **Problems** seeking solutions
- **Solutions** looking for problems to solve
- **Participants** moving in and out of process
- **Choice opportunities** arising unpredictably

**Cohen, March, and Olsen's Model:**
Solutions may be chosen based on:

- Who happens to be in the room
- What solutions are readily available
- Timing of when choices must be made
- Political pressures of the moment

### Criminal Justice Examples

**Major Incident Response:**

- **Multiple problems:** Public safety threat, media pressure, political demands
- **Multiple solutions:** Deploy SWAT, call for mutual aid, hold press conference
- **Multiple participants:** Police commanders, mayor, emergency management, media
- **Result:** Solutions chosen based on availability and who's present

**Crisis Budget Cuts:**

- **Problem:** Sudden revenue shortfall requiring immediate cuts
- **Solutions:** Hiring freeze, equipment delays, service reductions
- **Participants:** Police chief, city manager, union representatives, council members
- **Process:** Quick decisions based on what's politically feasible and immediately available

**Court Emergency Procedures:**

- **Problem:** Courthouse closure due to emergency
- **Solutions:** Virtual hearings, case postponements, remote operations
- **Participants:** Judges, court administrators, IT staff, attorneys
- **Decision:** Use whatever technology and procedures are immediately implementable

### When Garbage Can Occurs

- Crisis situations requiring immediate action
- High uncertainty about problems and solutions
- Multiple urgent issues competing for attention
- Unclear authority or responsibility
- Fluid participation with people entering and leaving the process

### Managing Garbage Can Situations

- Pre-planning: develop emergency procedures in advance
- Clear authority: designate who makes decisions under pressure
- Communication: ensure key information reaches decision-makers
- Documentation: record decisions for later review and learning
- After-action review: analyze what worked and what did not

## Real-World Example: Police Use-of-Force Policy

### Rational Approach

1. **Research** national best practices and legal requirements
2. **Analyze** current incidents and training gaps
3. **Develop** multiple policy options with stakeholder input
4. **Evaluate** options using legal, practical, and community criteria
5. **Select** best policy based on comprehensive analysis
6. **Implement** with training, equipment, and monitoring systems

### Bounded Rational Approach

1. **Review** model policies from similar departments
2. **Adapt** existing policy to address immediate concerns
3. **Quick consultation** with legal counsel and training staff
4. **Select** workable policy that meets basic requirements
5. **Implement** with standard training and supervision

### Incremental Approach

1. **Start** with current policy as baseline
2. **Identify** specific problems needing adjustment
3. **Make small changes** to address each problem
4. **Test** changes through pilot programs or specific units
5. **Gradually expand** successful modifications department-wide

### Garbage Can Scenario

1. **Crisis event** creates immediate pressure for policy change
2. **Multiple solutions** proposed simultaneously by different groups
3. **Quick decision** based on who's available and what's politically feasible
4. **Implementation** using available resources and procedures

## Practical Guidelines for Decision-Makers

### Choosing Your Approach

**Ask These Questions:**

1. **How much time do I have?**
2. **What information is available?**
3. **How important is this decision?**
4. **Who needs to be involved?**
5. **What resources are available?**
6. **How much risk can we accept?**

### Hybrid Strategies

**Most real decisions combine elements:**

- **Start with bounded rationality** for quick assessment
- **Use incremental approach** for implementation
- **Apply rational analysis** for key components
- **Prepare for garbage can** situations through planning

### Common Mistakes

- Using the wrong model for the situation, such as applying rational analysis during a crisis
- Getting stuck in "analysis paralysis" by over-analyzing routine decisions
- Ignoring political realities when using the rational model in politically sensitive situations
- Failing to plan ahead for unpredictable or chaotic (garbage can) situations
- Relying on a one-size-fits-all approach instead of adapting to the specific decision context
