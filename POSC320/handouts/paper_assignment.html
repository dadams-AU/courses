      <h2 class="subtitle">CRJU/POSC 320: Public Administration Theory
and Practice</h2>
      <p class="byline">By David P. Adams, Ph.D.</p>
      
    </header>

    <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
    <p>You will analyze one of three current public administration
    challenges through a 5-week scaffolded project using Google Docs
    with tracked changes. Each week builds on course concepts and
    requires specific integration with your Kettl textbook. By the end
    of Week 5, you will have created a professional policy brief
    demonstrating your understanding of public administration theory and
    practice.</p>
    <p><strong>Total Project Value: 45% of course grade</strong>
    <strong>Research Logs: 10% of course grade (graded
    separately)</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Policy Brief Project Grade Breakdown:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Week 1: 10% of Policy Brief grade (Problem Statement &amp;
    Research Foundation)</li>
    <li>Week 2: 15% of Policy Brief grade (Stakeholder Analysis &amp;
    Context)</li>
    <li>Week 3: 20% of Policy Brief grade (Organizational Theory
    Application)</li>
    <li>Week 4: 25% of Policy Brief grade (Management Challenges &amp;
    Solutions)</li>
    <li>Week 5: 30% of Policy Brief grade (Final Recommendations &amp;
    Polish)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Research Log Grading:</strong> Each weekly Research Log
    is worth 2% of your total course grade (5 weeks √ó 2% = 10% total).
    Research Logs are evaluated on evidence of genuine engagement with
    sources, reflection on learning process, and connection to course
    concepts.</p>

    id="option-1-who-gets-help-disaster-relief-and-administrative-discretion">Option
    1: ‚ÄúWho Gets Help?‚Äù ‚Äî Disaster Relief and Administrative
    Discretion</h3>
    <p><strong>Prompt:</strong><br />
    Analyze how public agencies decide <em>who gets help first</em>
    after disasters like wildfires, floods, or extreme heat events.
    Focus on one case (e.g.¬†Maui fires, Hurricane Ian, California
    wildfires) and examine how values like efficiency, equity, and
    accountability were balanced (or not).</p>
    <p><strong>Key Themes:</strong><br />
    - Administrative discretion - Equity in service delivery -
    Interagency coordination - Public trust and transparency</p>

    2: ‚ÄúSmart Tech, Safe City?‚Äù ‚Äî Surveillance and Public Safety in
    Local Government</h3>
    <p><strong>Prompt:</strong><br />
    Explore how a local government or law enforcement agency is using
    surveillance tech (e.g.¬†drones, license plate readers, facial
    recognition). Analyze the administrative challenges of implementing
    this tech: who oversees it, how it‚Äôs budgeted, and how it affects
    public trust.</p>

    - Accountability and innovation - Local governance and discretion -
    Regulation and civil liberties - Performance and budgeting</p>

    3: ‚ÄúIs This Working?‚Äù ‚Äî Evaluating a Public Program in Your
    Community</h3>
    <p><strong>Prompt:</strong><br />
    Choose a local public program‚Äîsomething your city or county is doing
    (e.g.¬†homelessness response, water conservation, youth services).
    Evaluate how effective it is and what administrative challenges it
    faces. Use Kettl‚Äôs frameworks to diagnose problems and recommend
    improvements.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Themes:</strong><br />
    - Program performance and evaluation - Administrative capacity -
    Budgeting and implementation - Community impact</p>
