### Overview

You will analyze one of three current public administration challenges through a 5-week scaffolded project using Google Docs with tracked changes. Each week builds on course concepts and requires specific integration with your Kettl textbook. By the end of Week 5, you will have created a professional policy brief demonstrating your understanding of public administration theory and practice.

**Total Project Value: 45% of course grade**
**Research Logs: 10% of course grade (graded separately)**

**Policy Brief Project Grade Breakdown:**

- Week 1: 10% of Policy Brief grade (Problem Statement & Research Foundation)
- Week 2: 15% of Policy Brief grade (Stakeholder Analysis & Context)
- Week 3: 20% of Policy Brief grade (Organizational Theory Application)
- Week 4: 25% of Policy Brief grade (Management Challenges & Solutions)
- Week 5: 30% of Policy Brief grade (Final Recommendations & Polish)

**Research Log Grading:**
Each weekly Research Log is worth 2% of your total course grade (5 weeks × 2% = 10% total). Research Logs are evaluated on evidence of genuine engagement with sources, reflection on learning process, and connection to course concepts.

## Topic Options (Choose One)

### Option 1: "Who Gets Help?" — Disaster Relief and Administrative Discretion

**Prompt:**  
Analyze how public agencies decide *who gets help first* after disasters like wildfires, floods, or extreme heat events. Focus on one case (e.g. Maui fires, Hurricane Ian, California wildfires) and examine how values like efficiency, equity, and accountability were balanced (or not).

**Key Themes:**  
- Administrative discretion
- Equity in service delivery
- Interagency coordination
- Public trust and transparency

### Option 2: "Smart Tech, Safe City?" — Surveillance and Public Safety in Local Government

**Prompt:**  
Explore how a local government or law enforcement agency is using surveillance tech (e.g. drones, license plate readers, facial recognition). Analyze the administrative challenges of implementing this tech: who oversees it, how it’s budgeted, and how it affects public trust.

**Key Themes:**  
- Accountability and innovation
- Local governance and discretion
- Regulation and civil liberties
- Performance and budgeting

**Kettl Links:**  
Ch. 3 (Gov’t Functions), Ch. 4–5 (Organizational Theory & Executive Structure), Ch. 9–10 (Regulation & Accountability)

### Option 3: "Is This Working?" — Evaluating a Public Program in Your Community

**Prompt:**  
Choose a local public program—something your city or county is doing (e.g. homelessness response, water conservation, youth services). Evaluate how effective it is and what administrative challenges it faces. Use Kettl’s frameworks to diagnose problems and recommend improvements.

**Key Themes:**  
- Program performance and evaluation
- Administrative capacity
- Budgeting and implementation
- Community impact
