## ðŸš« Academic Integrity Reminders

The following will result in **automatic zero** for that weekâ€™s assignment:

- Large blocks of text appearing suddenly without revision history  
- Generic, off-topic, or AI-generated analysis without citation  
- Inaccurate or missing references to Kettl  
- Research logs that donâ€™t match document development  
- Copy-paste content without attribution

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success

- Follow the weekly prompts closely and cite Kettl every time
- Write incrementally: don't paste in large sections all at once
- Use tracked changes in Google Docs to show your process
- Be specific. Avoid generic or vague analysisâ€”use real cases, data, and clear logic
- Use your Research Log to explain what youâ€™re learning and how your thinking is evolving
