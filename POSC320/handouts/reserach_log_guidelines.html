    <h2 id="what-is-a-research-log">📚 What Is a Research Log?</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Research Log</strong> is a weekly writing task (2–3
    sentences) that tracks your thought process as you build your Policy
    Brief. It’s not a summary of what you wrote—it’s a reflection on
    what you learned, struggled with, or discovered.</p>
    <p>You will complete <strong>one log entry per week</strong>,
    embedded directly at the end of your policy brief Google Doc.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2 id="purpose">🎯 Purpose</h2>
    <p>Research Logs help you:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Reflect on your <strong>research process</strong>, not just your
    results</li>
    <li>Track how your understanding of the issue is evolving</li>
    <li>Show me how you’re <strong>thinking about public
    administration</strong></li>
    <li>Demonstrate <strong>genuine engagement</strong> with course
    materials</li>
    </ul>
    <p>They also help protect your work against concerns about AI use by
    making your development process more transparent.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2 id="what-to-write">✍️ What to Write</h2>
    <p>Each week, answer the question:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>“What did I learn this week from my research that helped me
    understand the problem, context, or solutions better?”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Here are some example sentence starters:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><em>This week I found a report from the GAO showing…</em></li>
    <li><em>I learned that the challenge is more about X than I
    originally thought…</em></li>
    <li><em>I’m struggling to find a source that explains…</em></li>
    <li><em>I realized my original framing missed…</em></li>
    <li><em>The Kettl chapter changed how I think about…</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="sample-log-entries">🔎 Sample Log Entries</h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>This week I found a Brookings report on pandemic telework
    that helped me frame the management problem more clearly. It showed
    how unclear performance expectations created confusion, which ties
    into Kettl’s point about accountability (p. 117).</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>I originally thought the vaccine coordination problem was
    just about logistics. But after reading a CRS report, I realized the
    real issue was unclear federal guidance, which is an
    intergovernmental challenge. I might revise my problem
    statement.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>I found a lot of political rhetoric about infrastructure
    funding but fewer actual evaluations. That surprised me. I may need
    to rely more on GAO reports and implementation studies to explain
    the performance side.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <hr />
    <h2 id="when-is-it-due">📅 When Is It Due?</h2>
    <p>Each week, your Research Log is due at the same time as your
    policy brief draft:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Saturday, 11:59 PM</strong>, Weeks 1–4<br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>Friday, 11:59 PM</strong>, Week 5 (final
    reflection)</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h2 id="why-it-matters">💡 Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>The Research Log is worth <strong>10% of your final course
    grade</strong>, and it helps me see your <strong>growth as a public
    administration thinker</strong>.</p>
    <p>Think of it as your <strong>intellectual breadcrumb
    trail</strong>—a record of how you wrestled with a real problem in
    real time.</p>
    <p>It’s not just about the final product; it’s about how you got
    there.</p>
