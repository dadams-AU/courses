  <h2 id="what-is-public-administration-1">What is Public
  Administration?</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Public administration</strong> is the study of how public
  organizations function and how they are managed</li>
  <li>Public organizations are characterized as
  <strong>bureaucracies</strong>‚Äîformal rational systems with
  administrative authority to execute public programs</li>
  <li>Bureaucracy‚Äôs association with authority and accountability dates
  back to 14th century France</li>
  <li><strong>Civil servants</strong> play a critical role in public
  service</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Police departments, city managers,
  federal agencies, court administrators, corrections facilities</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="public-vs.-private-administration">Public vs.¬†Private
  Administration</h2>
  <p><strong>Public administration:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Implements public policy in the public interest</li>
  <li>Involves political conflict, requiring careful management</li>
  <li>Subject to greater public scrutiny and accountability</li>
  <li>Uses taxpayer money and public authority</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> It‚Äôs not just about <em>what</em> we
  do, but <em>how</em> we do it</p>
  <hr />
  <h3 id="public-vs.-private-the-environment">Public vs.¬†Private: The
  Environment</h3>
  <p><strong>Different Operating Environment:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Public Scrutiny:</strong> Public orgs operate in ‚Äúfish
  bowls‚Äù</li>
  <li><strong>Political Demands:</strong> Must balance competing
  political pressures</li>
  <li><strong>Legal Constraints:</strong> Bound by statutes,
  regulations, due process</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> A police chief can‚Äôt simply ‚Äúfire‚Äù
  problem officers like a private CEO‚Äîmust follow civil service
  procedures, union contracts, and due process requirements</p>
  <hr />
  <h3 id="public-vs.-private-the-mission">Public vs.¬†Private: The
  Mission</h3>
  <p><strong>Different Bottom Line:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Not Profit-Driven:</strong> Success measured by public
  benefit, not revenue</li>
  <li><strong>Competing Standards:</strong> Must balance efficiency,
  equity, and responsiveness</li>
  <li><strong>Career Service:</strong> Staffed by professional civil
  servants, not shareholders</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> A private security firm prioritizes
  client satisfaction and profit. A police department must serve
  everyone equally, regardless of ability to pay</p>
  <hr />
  <h3 id="public-vs.-private-the-authority">Public vs.¬†Private: The
  Authority</h3>
  <p><strong>Different Scope of Authority:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Limited Authority:</strong> Can only do what law
  permits</li>
  <li><strong>Oversight:</strong> Subject to legislative, judicial, and
  public oversight</li>
  <li><strong>Persuasion:</strong> Managers must persuade rather than
  command</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> A city manager wants to implement a new
  program but needs council approval, public hearings, and budget
  authorization‚Äîunlike a private executive‚Äôs unilateral decisions</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="policy-execution-vs.-policy-making">Policy Execution
  vs.¬†Policy Making</h2>
  <h3 id="policy-execution-implementation">Policy Execution
  (Implementation)</h3>
  <p><strong>Translating policy into action through:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Expanding opportunities:</strong> Extending services and
  protections</li>
  <li><strong>Regulating behavior:</strong> Enforcing rules and
  standards<br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Redistributing resources:</strong> Moving resources
  between groups</li>
  <li><strong>Protecting public safety:</strong> Preventing harm</li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <h3 id="policy-execution-real-examples">Policy Execution: Real
  Examples</h3>
  <p><strong>Police Department Example:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Policy:</strong> Community policing initiative</li>
  <li><strong>Execution:</strong> Training officers, changing patrol
  patterns, establishing neighborhood liaison programs</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Corrections Example:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Policy:</strong> Rehabilitation over punishment</li>
  <li><strong>Execution:</strong> Implementing job training programs,
  mental health services, education courses</li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <h3 id="policy-making">Policy Making</h3>
  <p><strong>Public administrators help make policy in two
  stages:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Policy Formulation:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Identifying problems and developing solutions</li>
  <li>Providing technical expertise to elected officials</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Policy Implementation:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Translating broad policy goals into specific actions</li>
  <li>Making thousands of daily decisions that shape policy
  outcomes</li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <h3 id="policy-making-the-administrators-role">Policy Making: The
  Administrator‚Äôs Role</h3>
  <p><strong>Example: Body-Worn Cameras</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Formulation stage:</strong> Police administrators advise
  city council on costs, benefits, privacy concerns</li>
  <li><strong>Implementation stage:</strong> Administrators decide when
  to activate, how to store data, disciplinary procedures</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Reality:</strong> The line between making and executing
  policy is often blurred</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="administrative-responsibility">Administrative
  Responsibility</h2>
  <p><strong>Public administrators are responsible for effective and
  efficient policy implementation</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Complex system of accountability:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Statutes and regulations</strong> limit administrators‚Äô
  discretion</li>
  <li><strong>Legislative oversight</strong> committees monitor
  actions</li>
  <li><strong>Budgetary oversight</strong> controls resources</li>
  <li><strong>Judicial review</strong> ensures legal compliance</li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <h3
  id="administrative-responsibility-competing-loyalties">Administrative
  Responsibility: Competing Loyalties</h3>
  <p><strong>Administrators must balance commitments to:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Legal authorities:</strong> Following laws and court
  orders</li>
  <li><strong>Agency mission:</strong> Loyalty to their organization and
  programs</li>
  <li><strong>Professional standards:</strong> Maintaining professional
  credibility</li>
  <li><strong>Public interest:</strong> Serving citizens
  effectively</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> A corrections administrator balancing
  court-ordered reforms, department tradition, professional best
  practices, and public safety concerns</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="accountability">Accountability</h2>
  <p><strong>Accountability = obligation to explain and justify actions
  to higher authority</strong></p>
  <p><strong>The fundamental tension:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>External controls</strong> ‚Üí rules, procedures, red
  tape</li>
  <li><strong>Internal controls</strong> ‚Üí professional discretion, but
  requires trust</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Real challenge:</strong> How do we ensure accountability
  without strangling effectiveness?</p>
  <hr />
  <h3 id="accountability-in-action">Accountability in Action</h3>
  <p><strong>Police Example:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>External:</strong> Civilian oversight boards, body
  cameras, court oversight</li>
  <li><strong>Internal:</strong> Professional standards, training,
  supervisory review</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Courts Example:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>External:</strong> Appellate review, legislative
  oversight, media scrutiny<br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Internal:</strong> Judicial ethics, peer review,
  professional norms</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Question:</strong> Which approach works better? When?</p>
  <hr />

  politics is Greek but our administration is Roman.‚Äù</h2>
  <p><em>What does this mean for American public
  administration?</em></p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="theory-and-practice">Theory and Practice</h2>
  <p><strong>Public administration is both theoretical and
  practical</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Bound by time, place, culture, and context</li>
  <li>How do we advance the field with limited generalizations?</li>
  <li>Need both universal principles and contextual understanding</li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <h3 id="theory-and-practice-universal-elements">Theory and Practice:
  Universal Elements</h3>
  <p><strong>Some things are universal:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Selection, motivation, control, and coordination of human
  behavior</li>
  <li>Budgeting, accounting, and record keeping</li>
  <li>Basic management functions</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>But remember:</strong> There is no ‚Äúone best way‚Äù to
  organize and manage public organizations</p>
  <hr />
  <h3 id="theory-and-practice-what-really-matters">Theory and Practice:
  What Really Matters?</h3>
  <p><strong>Both the theoretical AND the practical:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Theorists</strong> inform practitioners with research and
  frameworks</li>
  <li><strong>Practitioners</strong> inform theorists with real-world
  insights</li>
  <li><strong>Together</strong> they advance the field</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> Research on police legitimacy and
  procedural justice informs training and policy, while practitioner
  experience shapes new research questions</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="what-is-public-administration-2">What is Public

  authority</li>
  <li>Involves both policy execution and policy making</li>
  <li>Requires balancing competing responsibilities and loyalties</li>
  <li>Demands both external and internal accountability</li>
  <li>Combines theory and practice to serve the public interest</li>
