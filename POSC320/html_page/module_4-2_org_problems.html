  <h2 id="the-reality-check">The Reality Check</h2>
  <p><strong>Do organizations have problems?</strong> <em>Yes - all of
  them, all the time</em></p>
  <p><strong>Can they be fixed?</strong> <em>Sometimes, but it’s
  complicated</em></p>
  <p><strong>Today’s focus:</strong> Understanding why public
  organizations struggle and what can be done about it</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="the-politics-performance-paradox">The Politics-Performance
  Paradox</h2>
  <h3 id="why-government-gets-criticized">Why Government Gets
  Criticized</h3>
  <p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Most government programs work
  reasonably well most of the time</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Mail gets delivered, streets get paved, criminals get
  arrested</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> When government fails, it fails
  publicly and spectacularly</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Hurricane response failures, police misconduct, court
  backlogs</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Government does what private sector
  can’t or won’t do</p>
  <ul>
  <li>National defense, law enforcement, criminal justice, emergency
  response</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="why-public-organizations-are-different">Why Public
  Organizations Are Different</h2>
  <h3 id="unique-pressures-they-face">Unique Pressures They Face</h3>
  <p><strong>Multiple Bottom Lines:</strong> Efficiency + equity +
  legality + political feasibility <strong>Public Scrutiny:</strong>
  Every decision is potentially front-page news<br />
  <strong>Political Interference:</strong> Electoral cycles
  vs. long-term planning <strong>Diverse Stakeholders:</strong> Elected
  officials, interest groups, media, citizens <strong>Limited
  Authority:</strong> Can only do what law permits <strong>Resource
  Constraints:</strong> Budgets set by others, can’t easily raise
  revenue</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="three-fundamental-organizational-values">Three Fundamental
  Organizational Values</h2>
  <h3 id="the-eternal-tension">The Eternal Tension</h3>
  <p><strong>Neutral Competence:</strong> Professional, non-partisan
  expertise <strong>Executive Leadership:</strong> Responsive to elected
  leadership <strong>Representativeness:</strong> Responsive to diverse
  community interests</p>
  <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> These three values often conflict
  with each other</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="value-1-neutral-competence">Value 1: Neutral Competence</h2>
  <h3 id="just-the-facts-maam">“Just the Facts, Ma’am”</h3>

  <li>Consistent application of rules and procedures</li>
  <li>Insulated from political pressure and favoritism</li>
  <li>Merit-based hiring and promotion</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Criminal Justice Examples:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li>FBI investigations follow evidence, not political preferences</li>
  <li>Crime lab results based on science, not desired outcomes</li>
  <li>Court decisions based on law, not political pressure</li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="neutral-competence-benefits-and-problems">Neutral Competence:

  law vs. community demands for aggressive enforcement</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="value-2-executive-leadership">Value 2: Executive
  Leadership</h2>
  <h3 id="elections-have-consequences">“Elections Have
  Consequences”</h3>
  <p><strong>The Ideal:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Organizations respond to elected leadership</li>
  <li>Political appointees translate voter preferences into action</li>
  <li>Clear accountability through electoral process</li>
  <li>Ability to change direction with new leadership</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Criminal Justice Examples:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li>New mayor changes police chief and policing priorities</li>
  <li>New prosecutor emphasizes different types of crimes</li>
  <li>New corrections director shifts from punishment to
  rehabilitation</li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="executive-leadership-benefits-and-problems">Executive
  Leadership: Benefits and Problems</h2>

  <li>Political loyalty may conflict with professional judgment</li>
  <li>Partisan interference in professional decisions</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> Pressure on prosecutors to pursue

  evidence</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="value-3-representativeness">Value 3: Representativeness</h2>
  <h3 id="government-by-the-people">“Government by the People”</h3>

  <li>Organizations reflect community diversity</li>
  <li>Responsive to various stakeholder groups</li>
  <li>Multiple access points for citizen input</li>
  <li>Decisions consider all affected parties</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Criminal Justice Examples:</strong></p>

  <li>Police departments reflecting community demographics</li>
  <li>Community policing councils and oversight boards</li>
  <li>Victim impact statements in sentencing</li>
  <li>Citizen review of police misconduct cases</li>
  </ul>
  <hr />

  aggressive policing with civil rights concerns</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="the-impossible-triangle">The Impossible Triangle</h2>
  <h3 id="why-organizations-struggle">Why Organizations Struggle</h3>
  <p><strong>You can’t maximize all three values
  simultaneously:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li>More neutral competence = less political responsiveness</li>
  <li>More executive leadership = less representativeness<br />
  </li>
  <li>More representativeness = less neutral competence</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Real Example:</strong> Police reform efforts must
  balance:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Professional law enforcement standards (neutral competence)</li>
  <li>Mayor’s campaign promises (executive leadership)</li>
  <li>Community demands for change (representativeness)</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Different agencies with overlapping missions</li>
  <li>Information not shared between organizations</li>

  <li>Turf battles and resource competition</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Criminal Justice Example:</strong> Drug enforcement
  involving DEA, state police, local police, prosecutors, courts,
  corrections - all with different priorities and procedures</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="coordination-real-world-examples">Coordination: Real-World
  Examples</h2>
  <p><strong>Multi-Agency Drug Task Force Challenges:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Federal agents</strong> focus on major traffickers</li>
  <li><strong>State police</strong> emphasize interstate
  operations<br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Local police</strong> prioritize street-level dealing</li>
  <li><strong>Prosecutors</strong> want cases they can win</li>
  <li><strong>Courts</strong> face backlog pressures</li>
  <li><strong>Corrections</strong> deals with overcrowding</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Result:</strong> Mixed messages, duplicated efforts, missed
  opportunities</p>

  crime fighting</li>
  <li>Administrative units grow while patrol staffing shrinks</li>
  </ul>
