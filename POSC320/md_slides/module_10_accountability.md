## Final Course Question

**After everything we've studied - organizational theory, decision-making, budgeting, implementation, regulation - one question remains:**

**Who's watching the watchers?**

**Recent headlines:**

- "Police Department Under Federal Investigation"
- "City Manager Fired Over Budget Scandal"
- "Court System Sued for Civil Rights Violations"
- "Corrections Officer Charged with Abuse"

**Today's capstone:** Understanding how democratic societies hold public administrators accountable while still allowing them to do their jobs effectively

## What Is Accountability Really?

### More Than Just "Being Responsible"

**Accountability = The obligation to answer for one's actions to some higher authority**

**Three Components:**

1. **Answerability:** Obligation to provide information and explanations
2. **Enforceability:** Consequences for poor performance or misconduct  
3. **Controllability:** Ability to direct, influence, or constrain behavior

**Criminal Justice Examples:**

- **Police officer:** Answerable to supervisor, enforceable through discipline, controllable through policies
- **Prosecutor:** Answerable to voters/elected officials, enforceable through elections, controllable through legal ethics
- **Judge:** Answerable to appellate courts, enforceable through reversal/removal, controllable through legal precedent

---

## Why Accountability Matters in Criminal Justice

### The Stakes Are Higher

**Government power in criminal justice:**

- **Authority to arrest:** Taking away freedom
- **Power to prosecute:** Seeking punishment
- **Judicial authority:** Determining guilt and sentences
- **Corrections control:** Managing incarcerated populations

**Without accountability:**

- Police brutality and excessive force
- Prosecutorial misconduct and wrongful convictions
- Judicial bias and corruption
- Correctional abuse and neglect

**Democratic principle:** Those who exercise power on behalf of the people must answer to the people

---

## The Accountability Challenge

### Balancing Competing Demands

**Professional Autonomy vs. Democratic Control:**

- **Police:** Need discretion to handle diverse situations
- **Prosecutors:** Professional judgment about which cases to pursue
- **Judges:** Independence from political pressure
- **Corrections:** Security and treatment decisions

**Expertise vs. Responsiveness:**

- **Technical decisions:** Require professional knowledge
- **Value decisions:** Should reflect community preferences
- **Crisis situations:** Need quick, expert response
- **Long-term policy:** Requires public input and support

**Efficiency vs. Process:**

- **Speed:** Getting things done quickly
- **Thoroughness:** Following proper procedures
- **Cost control:** Managing limited resources
- **Due process:** Protecting rights and fairness

---

## Types of Accountability

### Multiple Mechanisms for Different Purposes

**Political Accountability:** Answerable to elected officials and voters

- *Example: Police chief reports to mayor, sheriff elected by voters*

**Legal Accountability:** Answerable to courts and law

- *Example: Court review of police searches, appeals of convictions*

**Administrative Accountability:** Answerable within the organization

- *Example: Internal affairs investigations, performance evaluations*

**Professional Accountability:** Answerable to professional standards

- *Example: Bar discipline for prosecutors, medical ethics for corrections healthcare*

**Social Accountability:** Answerable to the public and community

- *Example: Civilian oversight boards, community policing councils*

---

## Legislative Oversight: The Congressional Model

### How Legislatures Hold Agencies Accountable

**Tools of Legislative Oversight:**

- **Budget control:** Funding decisions and budget hearings
- **Confirmation power:** Approving agency leadership appointments
- **Investigation authority:** Subpoenas, hearings, document requests
- **Legislative mandates:** Laws requiring specific actions or reports

**Criminal Justice Examples:**

- **Congressional hearings:** FBI oversight, federal prison conditions
- **State legislature:** Police training standards, court funding
- **City council:** Police budget review, oversight of chief

**Effectiveness varies:** Strong tools but limited time and attention

---

## The Separation of Powers Challenge

### Constitutional Framework and Practical Problems

**Constitutional Design:**

- **Legislative branch:** Makes laws, controls budgets
- **Executive branch:** Implements laws, manages agencies
- **Judicial branch:** Interprets laws, reviews actions

**Real-world complexity:**

- **Agencies:** Combine legislative (rule-making), executive (enforcement), and judicial (adjudication) functions
- **Independence:** Some agencies designed to be independent from political control
- **Expertise:** Technical decisions may be beyond legislative competence

**Criminal Justice Example:** Police departments

- Report to mayors (executive accountability)
- Funded by city councils (legislative accountability)
- Constrained by courts (judicial accountability)
- Regulated by state agencies (administrative accountability)

---

## Oversight Mechanisms: Police Patrol vs. Fire Alarm

### Two Models of Accountability

**Police Patrol Model:**

- **Continuous monitoring:** Regular, ongoing oversight
- **Proactive:** Looking for problems before they become crises
- **Resource intensive:** Requires dedicated staff and attention
- *Example: Regular budget reviews, performance monitoring*

**Fire Alarm Model:**

- **Reactive monitoring:** Responding to complaints and crises
- **Triggered by problems:** Outside parties raise alarms
- **Event driven:** Focus on specific incidents or issues
- *Example: Investigation after misconduct allegations*

**Criminal Justice Applications:**

- **Police patrol:** Regular community meetings, performance dashboards
- **Fire alarm:** Media investigations, citizen complaints, civil rights lawsuits
