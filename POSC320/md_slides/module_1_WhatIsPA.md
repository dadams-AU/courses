### What is Public Administration?

- Public administration is the study of how public organizations function and how they are managed.
- Public organizations are characterized as bureaucracies, formal rational systems with administrative authority to execute public programs.
- Bureaucracy's association with authority and accountability dates back to 14th century France.
- Civil servants play a critical role in public service.

---

### Public vs. Private Administration

- Public administration 
  - is often contrasted with private administration.
  - is concerned with the implementation of public policy.
  - involves political conflict, requiring careful management.
  - is subject to greater public scrutiny and accountability.

---

### Public vs. Private Administration

Crucial differences: the **what** and **how** of administration

- Public organizations do the public's businessâ€”implementing public policy.
- They use different processes and work in different environments than private organizations.

---

#### Processes that make public administration different

- Career Service: Public orgs are staffed by career civil servants.
- The Bottom Line: Public orgs are not profit-driven.
- Competing Standards: Pubic orgs must balance efficiency, equity, and responsiveness.
- Public Scrutiny: Public orgs live in "fish bowls."
- Persuasion: Public managers persuade employees and balance conflicting political demands.
- Scope of Authority: Public orgs have limited authority and are required to administer programs according to law.
- Oversight: Public orgs are subject to oversight by elected officials and the public.

### Policy Execution vs. Policy Making

#### Policy Execution

- Public administration is concerned with the implementation of public policy.
- Policy execution is the process of translating public policy into action.
  - Expanding some individuals' opportunities by extending governmental services and protections to them.
  - Regulating the behavior of individuals and organizations.
  - Redistributing resources from some individuals to others.
  - Protecting the public from harm.

---

#### Policy Making

- Public administrators help decision makers make policy in two stages:
  - Policy formulation: identifying problems and developing solutions.
  - Policy implementation: translating policy into action.

---

### Administrative Responsibility

- Public administrators are responsible for the effective and efficient implementation of public policy.
- Complex and confining system of accountability:
  - Statutes and regulations limit administrators' discretion.
  - Legislative oversight committees monitor administrators' actions.
  - Budgetary oversight committees control administrators' resources.


---

### Administrative Responsibility

- Commitments that shape administrative responsibility:
  - Complex web of government and a legitimate role for other parts of government, including those with legal control over administrative behavior
  - Loyalty to agency and to the programs they carry out
  - Professional civil service standards and desire to be recognized by fellow professionals outside government


---

### Accountability

- Accountability is the obligation to explain and justify actions to some higher authority.
- Fundamental problem:
  - External controls lead to rules, standardized procedures, and red tape.
  - Internal controls can replace external oversight, but that requires trust between administrators and elected officials.

## Our politics is Greek but our administration is Roman.

### Theory and Practice

- Public administration is both a theoretical and practical field.
- Public administration is bound by time, place, culture, and context.
- How do we advance the field with limited generalizations?


--- 

### Theory and Practice

- Universal elements
  - Independent of time, place, and political system
  - Selection, motivation, control, and coordination of human behavior
  - Budgeting, accounting, and record keeping
- There is no one best way to organize and manage public organizations.
- PA as a field of study should be neutral but reflective of its polity

---

### Theory and Practice

#### What is really important?

- The theoretical _and_ the practical
- The theorist informing the practitioner
- The practitioner informing the theorist
