- Administrative responsibility
- Accountability
- Theory and practice

## What is Public Administration?

- **Public administration** is the study of how public organizations function and how they are managed
- Public organizations are characterized as **bureaucracies**—formal rational systems with administrative authority to execute public programs
- Bureaucracy's association with authority and accountability dates back to 14th century France
- **Civil servants** play a critical role in public service

**Examples:** Police departments, city managers, federal agencies, court administrators, corrections facilities

---

## Public vs. Private Administration

**Public administration:**

- Implements public policy in the public interest
- Involves political conflict, requiring careful management
- Subject to greater public scrutiny and accountability
- Uses taxpayer money and public authority

**Key insight:** It's not just about *what* we do, but *how* we do it

---

### Public vs. Private: The Environment

**Different Operating Environment:**

- **Public Scrutiny:** Public orgs operate in "fish bowls"
- **Political Demands:** Must balance competing political pressures
- **Legal Constraints:** Bound by statutes, regulations, due process

**Example:** A police chief can't simply "fire" problem officers like a private CEO—must follow civil service procedures, union contracts, and due process requirements

---

### Public vs. Private: The Mission

**Different Bottom Line:**

- **Not Profit-Driven:** Success measured by public benefit, not revenue
- **Competing Standards:** Must balance efficiency, equity, and responsiveness
- **Career Service:** Staffed by professional civil servants, not shareholders

**Example:** A private security firm prioritizes client satisfaction and profit. A police department must serve everyone equally, regardless of ability to pay

---

### Public vs. Private: The Authority

**Different Scope of Authority:**

- **Limited Authority:** Can only do what law permits
- **Oversight:** Subject to legislative, judicial, and public oversight
- **Persuasion:** Managers must persuade rather than command

**Example:** A city manager wants to implement a new program but needs council approval, public hearings, and budget authorization—unlike a private executive's unilateral decisions

---

## Policy Execution vs. Policy Making

### Policy Execution (Implementation)

**Translating policy into action through:**

- **Expanding opportunities:** Extending services and protections
- **Regulating behavior:** Enforcing rules and standards  
- **Redistributing resources:** Moving resources between groups
- **Protecting public safety:** Preventing harm

---

### Policy Execution: Real Examples

**Police Department Example:**

- **Policy:** Community policing initiative
- **Execution:** Training officers, changing patrol patterns, establishing neighborhood liaison programs

**Corrections Example:**

- **Policy:** Rehabilitation over punishment
- **Execution:** Implementing job training programs, mental health services, education courses

---

### Policy Making

**Public administrators help make policy in two stages:**

**Policy Formulation:**

- Identifying problems and developing solutions
- Providing technical expertise to elected officials

**Policy Implementation:**

- Translating broad policy goals into specific actions
- Making thousands of daily decisions that shape policy outcomes

---

### Policy Making: The Administrator's Role

**Example: Body-Worn Cameras**

- **Formulation stage:** Police administrators advise city council on costs, benefits, privacy concerns
- **Implementation stage:** Administrators decide when to activate, how to store data, disciplinary procedures

**Reality:** The line between making and executing policy is often blurred

---

## Administrative Responsibility

**Public administrators are responsible for effective and efficient policy implementation**

**Complex system of accountability:**

- **Statutes and regulations** limit administrators' discretion
- **Legislative oversight** committees monitor actions
- **Budgetary oversight** controls resources
- **Judicial review** ensures legal compliance

---

### Administrative Responsibility: Competing Loyalties

**Administrators must balance commitments to:**

- **Legal authorities:** Following laws and court orders
- **Agency mission:** Loyalty to their organization and programs
- **Professional standards:** Maintaining professional credibility
- **Public interest:** Serving citizens effectively

**Example:** A corrections administrator balancing court-ordered reforms, department tradition, professional best practices, and public safety concerns

---

## Accountability

**Accountability = obligation to explain and justify actions to higher authority**

**The fundamental tension:**

- **External controls** → rules, procedures, red tape
- **Internal controls** → professional discretion, but requires trust

**Real challenge:** How do we ensure accountability without strangling effectiveness?

---

### Accountability in Action

**Police Example:**

- **External:** Civilian oversight boards, body cameras, court oversight
- **Internal:** Professional standards, training, supervisory review

**Courts Example:**

- **External:** Appellate review, legislative oversight, media scrutiny  
- **Internal:** Judicial ethics, peer review, professional norms

**Question:** Which approach works better? When?

## "Our politics is Greek but our administration is Roman."

*What does this mean for American public administration?*

---

## Theory and Practice

**Public administration is both theoretical and practical**

- Bound by time, place, culture, and context
- How do we advance the field with limited generalizations?
- Need both universal principles and contextual understanding

---

### Theory and Practice: Universal Elements

**Some things are universal:**

- Selection, motivation, control, and coordination of human behavior
- Budgeting, accounting, and record keeping
- Basic management functions

**But remember:** There is no "one best way" to organize and manage public organizations

---

### Theory and Practice: What Really Matters?

**Both the theoretical AND the practical:**

- **Theorists** inform practitioners with research and frameworks
- **Practitioners** inform theorists with real-world insights
- **Together** they advance the field

**Example:** Research on police legitimacy and procedural justice informs training and policy, while practitioner experience shapes new research questions
