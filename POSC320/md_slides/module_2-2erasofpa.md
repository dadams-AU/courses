## Why Study the Evolution of Public Administration?

**Understanding the past helps us navigate the present:**

- Current practices evolved from specific historical contexts
- Each era responded to real problems and limitations of the previous approach
- Modern public administration blends elements from all eras

**Your agencies today reflect this evolution:**

- Police departments, courts, and corrections all show traces of different eras

## Five Eras of Public Administration

### The Timeline

**Old Public Administration** (1880s-1960s): Efficiency and hierarchy
**New Public Administration** (1960s-1980s): Equity and social justice
**New Public Management** (1980s-2000s): Market-based efficiency
**New Public Service** (2000s-present): Citizen-centered democracy
**New Public Governance** (2000s-present): Networks and collaboration

*Note: These overlap and coexist rather than completely replacing each other*

---

## Era 1: Old Public Administration (1880s-1960s)

### "There is a science of administration"

**Core Principles:**

- **Politics-Administration Dichotomy:** Clear separation of policy and implementation
- **Scientific Management:** One best way to organize work
- **Bureaucratic Hierarchy:** Clear chain of command and specialized roles
- **Merit-Based Employment:** Professional civil service

**Key Figures:** Woodrow Wilson, Max Weber, Frederick Taylor

## Old PA in Action: Criminal Justice Examples

**Police Departments:**

- Professional policing model: trained officers, standardized procedures
- Clear rank structure (patrol officer → sergeant → lieutenant → captain)
- Specialized units (traffic, detective, administration)

**Courts:**

- Formal procedures and rules of evidence
- Professional court administrators and clerks
- Standardized case processing systems

**Corrections:**

- Centralized prison systems with clear hierarchies
- Standardized operating procedures
- Professional staff selection and training

---

## Old PA: Strengths and Problems

### What Worked

- Reduced corruption through merit systems
- Increased efficiency and professionalism
- Created predictable, rule-based processes

### What Didn't Work

- **Rigidity:** Slow to adapt to changing needs
- **Dehumanization:** People became "cases" or "numbers"
- **Unresponsiveness:** Difficult for citizens to influence bureaucracy
- **Inequality:** Equal treatment didn't address unequal starting points

---

## Era 2: New Public Administration (1960s-1980s)

### "Administration is not value-neutral"

**The Minnowbrook Challenge (1968):**
Young scholars challenged Old PA's assumptions during social upheaval of the 1960s

**Core Principles:**

- **Social Equity:** Government should actively reduce inequality
- **Democratic Administration:** Citizens should participate in decisions
- **Representative Bureaucracy:** Public employees should reflect community diversity
- **Ethical Responsibility:** Administrators have moral obligations

---

## New PA in Criminal Justice

**Police Departments:**

- Community policing initiatives
- Civilian review boards and community oversight
- Efforts to diversify police forces
- Focus on police-community relations

**Courts:**

- Alternative dispute resolution programs
- Community courts and problem-solving courts
- Victim impact statements and restorative justice
- Efforts to make courts more accessible

**Corrections:**

- Rehabilitation over punishment emphasis
- Community-based alternatives to incarceration
- Prisoner rights movements and reforms

---

## Era 3: New Public Management (1980s-2000s)

### "Government should be run like a business"

**Market-Based Reforms:**

- **Privatization:** Contract out government services
- **Performance Management:** Measure results, not just processes
- **Customer Service:** Citizens as customers with choices
- **Decentralization:** Push decisions down to local level
- **Competition:** Create market-like conditions in government

**Key Figures:** David Osborne, Ted Gaebler ("Reinventing Government")

## NPM in Criminal Justice

**Police Departments:**

- CompStat and data-driven policing
- Performance metrics (response times, crime statistics)
- Contracting security services to private companies
- Customer satisfaction surveys

**Courts:**

- Case processing time standards
- Electronic filing and case management systems
- Performance dashboards and metrics
- Alternative service providers (mediation services)

**Corrections:**

- Private prison contracts
- Performance-based contracting
- Recidivism reduction incentives
- Cost-per-inmate metrics

---

## NPM: Benefits and Concerns

### What Worked

- Improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness
- Better performance measurement
- Enhanced customer service orientation
- Innovation through competition

### What Worried Critics

- **Democratic values:** Market logic vs. democratic accountability
- **Equity concerns:** Profitable vs. unprofitable services
- **Public interest:** Short-term efficiency vs. long-term public good
- **Employee relations:** Reduced job security and professional autonomy

---

## Era 4: New Public Service (2000s-present)

### "Serve citizens, not customers"

**Democratic Engagement Focus:**

- **Citizen Participation:** Active involvement in governance
- **Public Interest:** Broader than individual customer satisfaction
- **Democratic Values:** Accountability, transparency, participation
- **Collaborative Leadership:** Building coalitions and partnerships
- **Long-term Thinking:** Sustainable solutions over quick fixes

**Key Figures:** Janet and Robert Denhardt

## Era 5: New Public Governance (2000s-present)

### "Nobody governs alone"

**Network-Based Approach:**

- **Multi-sector Partnerships:** Government, nonprofits, private sector, citizens
- **Collaborative Networks:** Shared responsibility and resources
- **Co-production:** Citizens actively help deliver services
- **Digital Governance:** Technology-enabled participation
- **Adaptive Management:** Learning and adjusting through experience

---

## New PS & NPG in Criminal Justice

**Police Departments:**

- Community policing partnerships with nonprofits
- Collaborative problem-solving with residents
- Mental health crisis intervention teams (police + social workers)
- Neighborhood watch and civilian volunteer programs

**Courts:**

- Drug courts with treatment providers and community organizations
- Community justice centers
- Restorative justice circles involving victims, offenders, community
- Technology platforms for citizen feedback and participation

## How These Eras Coexist Today

**Modern police departments might have:**

- **Old PA:** Clear rank structure, standard operating procedures
- **New PA:** Community policing, diversity initiatives
- **NPM:** Performance metrics, technology investments
- **New PS:** Community engagement programs
- **NPG:** Multi-agency task forces, nonprofit partnerships

**The question:** How do we balance these different approaches?
