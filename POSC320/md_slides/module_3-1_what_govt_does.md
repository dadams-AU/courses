## Opening Question

**When you woke up this morning, how many times did government touch your life before you got to class?**

*Think about: water, roads, traffic lights, food safety, weather reports, emergency services...*

**Today's goal:** Understand what government actually does and how it does it

---

## Debunking the "Big Government" Myths

### Five Common Misconceptions

**Myth 1:** Government keeps getting bigger and bigger
**Myth 2:** Government wastes huge amounts of money  
**Myth 3:** Government employees are lazy and inefficient
**Myth 4:** Private sector always does things better
**Myth 5:** We can easily cut government without consequences

**Reality:** The picture is much more complex

## The Structure of American Government

### How Many Governments Do We Have?

**1 Federal Government**
**50 State Governments**
**90,000+ Local Governments:**

- 3,000+ counties
- 19,000+ municipalities  
- 16,000+ townships
- 13,000+ school districts
- 38,000+ special districts (water, fire, transit, etc.)

**Criminal Justice Implication:** This creates coordination challenges for law enforcement across jurisdictions

---

## Government Employment Reality Check

### Where Do Government Employees Actually Work?

**Federal:** 2.2 million civilian employees (about 15% of government workers)
**State:** 5.2 million employees
**Local:** 14.2 million employees (about 65% of government workers)

**Most government employees work for:**

- Schools and universities
- Police and fire departments  
- Hospitals and health services
- Transportation and utilities

---

## What Does Government Actually Do?

### Core Functions Across Levels

**Providing Services:**

- Education, public safety, infrastructure, health care

**Regulating Behavior:**

- Traffic laws, business regulations, environmental protection

**Redistributing Resources:**

- Social programs, economic development, disaster relief

**Protecting Rights:**

- Courts, law enforcement, civil rights enforcement

---

## Criminal Justice: A Multi-Level Example

**Federal Level:**

- FBI, DEA, federal courts, federal prisons
- Immigration enforcement, terrorism prevention

**State Level:**

- State police, state courts, state prisons
- Crime labs, training academies

**Local Level:**

- Municipal police, county sheriffs, local courts
- Local jails, community supervision

**The Challenge:** Coordinating across all these levels

---

## How Government Gets Things Done

### Direct vs. Indirect Administration

**Direct Administration:** Government employees provide the service

- *Examples: Police officers, firefighters, court clerks*

**Indirect Administration:** Government contracts with others to provide services

- *Examples: Private prisons, contracted security, private attorneys*

**Modern Reality:** Most government work involves both approaches

---

## Tool 1: Contracts

### Government by Contract

**The Growth of Contracting:**

- Massive increase since the 1980s
- Now used for everything from IT services to prison operations

**Criminal Justice Examples:**

- Private prisons and detention centers
- Contracted food services in jails
- Private security for government buildings
- Technology contractors for court systems

**Key Challenge:** How do you maintain accountability when someone else is doing the work?

---

## Contracting: Benefits and Risks

### Why Government Contracts Out

**Potential Benefits:**

- Specialized expertise
- Cost savings
- Flexibility in staffing
- Access to latest technology

**Potential Risks:**

- Loss of direct control
- Profit motive vs. public interest
- Accountability gaps
- Dependency on contractors

**Real Example:** Private prison debates - efficiency vs. justice concerns

---

## Tool 2: Grants

### Using Money to Encourage Action

**How Grants Work:**
Government provides funding to encourage activities that might not otherwise happen

**Criminal Justice Examples:**

- COPS grants for community policing
- Byrne Justice Assistance Grants for state/local programs
- VAWA grants for domestic violence programs
- Drug court implementation grants

**The Power:** Federal government can shape local priorities through grants

---

## Tool 3: Regulations

### The Rules That Shape Daily Life

**Regulations influence everything:**

- How police conduct searches and arrests
- Food safety in restaurants
- Building codes for jails and courthouses
- Environmental standards for government facilities

**Example:** Miranda rights - a court ruling that became standard police procedure nationwide

**The Tension:** Balancing necessary rules with flexibility and freedom

---

## Tool 4: Tax Expenditures

### Using the Tax Code to Encourage Behavior

**Tax Breaks as Policy Tools:**

- Mortgage interest deduction (encourages home ownership)
- Charitable deductions (supports nonprofits)
- Economic development tax credits for businesses

**Criminal Justice Connection:**

- Tax incentives for businesses that hire ex-offenders
- Property tax breaks for neighborhood watch programs
- Sales tax exemptions for public safety equipment

---

## Tool 5: Loan Programs

### Government as Lender and Guarantor

**Examples You Might Know:**

- Student loans for college
- Small business loans
- Disaster recovery loans
- Housing loans

**Criminal Justice Applications:**

- Loans for police equipment purchases
- Funding for jail construction projects
- Economic development loans for crime-affected areas

---

## The Reality: Government by Proxy

### What This Means

**Government today works through:**

- Federal employees + state employees + local employees
- Private contractors + nonprofit organizations
- Grantees + loan recipients + regulated entities

**Example:** A federal anti-drug program might involve:

- Federal DEA agents
- State-funded drug courts
- Locally-contracted treatment providers
- Nonprofit prevention programs
- Private laboratory services

---

## Why This Complexity Matters

### Accountability Challenges

**When things go wrong, who's responsible?**

- The contractor who failed to perform?
- The government agency that hired them?
- The elected official who approved the contract?

**Example:** Private prison problems - who's accountable for conditions?

**The Challenge:** Maintaining democratic accountability in a complex system

---

## The Trust and Effectiveness Question

### Public Perception vs. Reality

**Common Complaints:**

- "Government is too big"
- "Government wastes money"
- "Government doesn't work"

**Reality Check:**

- Most services people value are government-provided
- Government often works through private partners
- Problems often result from complex coordination needs

**Your Role:** Understanding how government really works helps you work within it more effectively

---

## Criminal Justice Coordination Example

### A Drug Investigation Case

**Federal:** DEA provides intelligence and resources
**State:** State police coordinate multi-county operations  
**Local:** Local police make arrests and gather evidence
**Courts:** Multiple court systems handle different aspects
**Corrections:** Various facilities house different defendants
**Private:** Labs analyze evidence, attorneys represent defendants

**Question:** How do you ensure this complex system works effectively?

---

## Implications for Public Administrators

### What This Means for Your Future Work

**You'll Need to:**

- Coordinate across multiple levels of government
- Manage contracts and partnerships effectively
- Navigate complex accountability relationships
- Balance efficiency with democratic values
- Work with diverse stakeholders and organizations

**Bottom Line:** Modern public administration is about managing networks, not just hierarchies
