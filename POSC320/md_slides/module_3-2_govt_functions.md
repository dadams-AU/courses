## From "What" to "How"

**Module 3-1:** We learned *what* government does (services, regulation, redistribution)
**Module 3-2:** Now we explore *how* government actually gets things done

**Key Question:** How do 90,000+ governments coordinate to provide services, enforce laws, and maintain order?

---

## The Federal System: Division of Labor

### Constitutional Framework

**Federal Government:** Powers explicitly granted (national defense, interstate commerce, currency)
**State Governments:** Powers not denied or given to federal (police powers, education, elections)
**Local Governments:** Powers delegated by states (zoning, local police, fire services)

**Reality:** These boundaries blur constantly in practice

---

## Criminal Justice: Federalism in Action

### How the System Divides Responsibilities

**Federal:**

- Terrorism, organized crime, interstate crimes
- Immigration enforcement, federal drug crimes
- Constitutional standards (Miranda, due process)

**State:**

- Most criminal law and procedure
- State police, prisons, courts
- Professional standards and training

**Local:**

- Day-to-day policing and prosecution
- Local jails, municipal courts
- Community-specific public safety needs

---

## Government Agencies: The Organizational Structure

### How Government Organizes Itself

**Departments:** Large, broad-mission organizations

- *Example: Department of Justice, State Department of Corrections*

**Agencies:** More specialized within departments

- *Example: FBI within DOJ, Parole Board within DOC*

**Independent Agencies:** Outside traditional departments

- *Example: Federal Trade Commission, state licensing boards*

**Question:** Why organize this way instead of one big agency?

---

## The Role of Public Administration

### Where Politics Ends and Administration Begins?

**Traditional View:** Politicians make policy, administrators implement it
**Reality:** Administrators influence policy through:

- **Expertise:** Technical knowledge politicians don't have
- **Implementation decisions:** How policies get carried out
- **Feedback:** Information about what works and what doesn't
- **Rule-making:** Filling in details of broad legislation

**Example:** Congress passes a crime bill, but agencies write the specific regulations

---

## Policy Making: The Real Process

### From Idea to Implementation

**1. Agenda Setting:** How issues get attention

- *Example: High-profile crime cases â†’ policy attention*

**2. Policy Formulation:** Developing solutions

- *Example: Task forces studying police reform options*

**3. Policy Adoption:** Official decision-making

- *Example: City council votes on new policing policies*

**4. Policy Implementation:** Making it happen

- *Example: Training officers, changing procedures*

**5. Policy Evaluation:** Assessing results

- *Example: Measuring crime reduction, community satisfaction*

---

## Implementation: Where Policies Meet Reality

### Why Good Policies Sometimes Fail

**Resource Constraints:** Not enough money, staff, or time
**Coordination Problems:** Multiple agencies, unclear responsibilities
**Resistance to Change:** Existing culture, procedures, interests
**Technical Challenges:** Complex problems, limited knowledge
**Political Opposition:** Continued disagreement about goals

**Case Study:** Body-worn camera policies - simple idea, complex implementation

---

## Fiscal Management: Following the Money

### How Government Budgeting Works

**Budget Preparation:** Agencies request, executives propose
**Budget Adoption:** Legislatures review, modify, approve
**Budget Execution:** Agencies spend according to plan
**Budget Monitoring:** Ongoing oversight and adjustment

**Criminal Justice Reality:** Competition for limited public safety dollars between police, courts, corrections, prevention

---

## Budgeting Challenges

### Why Government Budgeting is Different

**Multiple Goals:** Efficiency + equity + political feasibility
**Public Scrutiny:** Every decision is potentially controversial
**Long-term Commitments:** Pensions, infrastructure, debt service
**Economic Constraints:** Revenue depends on economic conditions
**Political Constraints:** Electoral pressures, interest group demands

**Example:** Deciding between hiring more police officers vs. funding drug treatment programs

---

## Regulatory Functions: Making and Enforcing Rules

### How Regulations Happen

**Legislative Authorization:** Congress/legislature grants rule-making power
**Proposed Rules:** Agencies draft specific regulations
**Public Comment:** Stakeholders provide input
**Final Rules:** Agencies issue binding regulations
**Enforcement:** Agencies monitor compliance and impose penalties

**Criminal Justice Example:** Police use-of-force policies - from law to department regulation to officer training

---

## Public Service Delivery Models

### Different Ways to Provide Services

**Direct Government Provision:** Government employees deliver services

- *Example: Municipal police department*

**Contracting Out:** Private companies deliver government-funded services

- *Example: Private prisons, contracted security*

**Grants and Partnerships:** Government funds others to provide services

- *Example: Nonprofit victim services, community policing partnerships*

**Regulation:** Government sets standards, others provide services

- *Example: Private security licensing, court-appointed attorneys*

---

## Government Contracting: The Process

### How Government Buys Goods and Services

**Planning:** Identify needs, develop specifications
**Solicitation:** Advertise opportunities, receive proposals
**Evaluation:** Compare proposals using stated criteria
**Award:** Select contractor and negotiate contract
**Management:** Monitor performance and payment
**Evaluation:** Assess results for future decisions

**Key Principles:** Competition, transparency, accountability

---

## Contracting Challenges

### When Contracting Goes Wrong

**Common Problems:**

- Unclear specifications lead to disputes
- Lowest bidder isn't always best performer
- Monitoring costs can exceed savings
- Political pressure influences decisions
- Loss of institutional knowledge

**Criminal Justice Example:** Private prison contracts - cost savings vs. quality concerns

---

## Government Grants: Encouraging Action

### How Grant Programs Work

**Formula Grants:** Distributed by predetermined criteria

- *Example: Community Development Block Grants based on population, poverty*

**Competitive Grants:** Awarded based on proposal quality

- *Example: COPS grants for innovative policing programs*

**Block Grants:** Broad purposes, local discretion

- *Example: Justice Assistance Grants for various criminal justice improvements*

**Categorical Grants:** Specific purposes, detailed requirements

- *Example: VAWA grants for domestic violence programs*

---

## Intergovernmental Relations: Making Federalism Work

### Coordination Mechanisms

**Formal Coordination:**

- Intergovernmental task forces
- Regional councils and authorities
- Interstate compacts and agreements

**Informal Coordination:**

- Professional networks and associations
- Information sharing systems
- Joint training and conferences

**Financial Coordination:**

- Federal grants to states and localities
- State aid to local governments
- Shared revenue programs

---

## IGR in Criminal Justice

### Real-World Coordination Examples

**Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces:**

- FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces
- Drug Enforcement Task Forces
- Gang suppression collaboratives

**Information Sharing:**

- National Crime Information Center (NCIC)
- State criminal history databases
- Intelligence fusion centers

**Standards and Training:**

- POST (Peace Officer Standards and Training) councils
- Federal training programs for local officers
- Certification and accreditation programs

---
