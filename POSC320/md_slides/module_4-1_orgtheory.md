## Why Does Organizational Theory Matter?

**You'll work in organizations your entire career:**

- Police departments, courts, corrections facilities
- Federal agencies, city governments, nonprofits
- Understanding how they work = understanding how to be effective

**Today's Question:** Why do some organizations work well while others struggle?

---

## Two Key Concepts

**Organizational Theory:** How organizations are structured and function

- *Focus: The "big picture" design and systems*

**Organizational Behavior:** How individuals and groups behave within organizations  

- *Focus: People, motivation, and interactions*

**Both matter:** Great structure with poor behavior fails. Great people with poor structure also fails.

---

## The Building Blocks of Public Organizations

### What Makes Organizations Tick?

**Structure Elements:**

- Mission and goals
- Size and hierarchy  
- Formal rules and procedures

**People Elements:**

- Workforce characteristics
- Organizational culture
- Leadership styles

**Environmental Elements:**

- Political pressures
- Public scrutiny
- Available resources

---

## Three Schools of Organizational Thought

### The Evolution of Ideas

**Classical School (1900s-1930s):** "There's one best way"

- Focus: Structure, efficiency, rules

**Human Relations School (1930s-1960s):** "People matter"  

- Focus: Motivation, relationships, satisfaction

**Modern Theories (1960s-present):** "It depends"

- Focus: Contingency, systems, networks

*Each school responded to problems with the previous approach*

---

## Classical School: The Foundation

### Six Core Principles

**1. Organize by Purpose, Process, Place, or People**

- *Example: Police organized by geography (precincts) vs. function (traffic, detective)*

**2. Can't Optimize Everything**  

- *Example: Faster case processing vs. thorough investigation*

**3. Focus on Purpose at the Top**

- *Example: Police chief coordinates patrol, detective, and administrative units*

---

## Classical School Principles (continued)

**4. Span of Control: How Many Can You Supervise?**

- *Example: Sergeant supervising 8-12 patrol officers*

**5. Unity of Command: One Boss**

- *Example: Officer reports to one sergeant, not multiple supervisors*

**6. Line vs. Staff Functions**

- *Line: Core mission (patrol officers, detectives)*
- *Staff: Support functions (HR, IT, training)*

---

## Max Weber's Bureaucracy

### The "Ideal" Organization (1920s)

**Weber's Key Features:**

- **Hierarchy:** Clear chain of command
- **Division of Labor:** Specialized roles and tasks
- **Formal Rules:** Written procedures for everything  
- **Impersonality:** Decisions based on rules, not relationships
- **Merit-Based Hiring:** Qualifications, not connections
- **Career Orientation:** Long-term employment and advancement

---

## Weber's Bureaucracy in Criminal Justice

**Police Department Example:**

- **Hierarchy:** Chief → Captain → Lieutenant → Sergeant → Officer
- **Specialization:** Patrol, detective, traffic, SWAT units
- **Rules:** Standard operating procedures, policy manuals
- **Merit Hiring:** Civil service exams, background checks
- **Career Path:** Promotional opportunities, pension systems

**Question:** What are the benefits and drawbacks of this approach?

---

## Frederick Taylor's Scientific Management

### "One Best Way" to Do Everything

**Taylor's Principles:**

- Study work scientifically to find the most efficient method
- Select and train workers scientifically  
- Cooperate with workers to ensure methods are followed
- Divide work: managers plan, workers execute

**Example:** Assembly line approach to processing arrests, court cases, or parole decisions

---

## Scientific Management in Practice

**Court Example:**

- Time each step of case processing
- Standardize paperwork and procedures
- Train clerks in most efficient methods
- Measure and reward productivity

**Benefits:** Faster processing, reduced errors, cost savings
**Problems:** Treats people like machines, ignores worker knowledge, can reduce quality

**Modern Application:** Some aspects still used in performance management

---

## The Human Relations Revolution

### People Aren't Machines (1930s-1950s)

**The Hawthorne Studies Discovery:**
Worker productivity increased when they received attention, regardless of working conditions

**Key Insights:**

- Social relationships affect performance
- Worker attitudes and morale matter
- Informal groups have power
- Participation in decisions improves outcomes

---

## Human Relations in Criminal Justice

**Police Example:**

- **Team building:** Squad cohesion affects performance
- **Morale matters:** Stressed, unhappy officers perform poorly
- **Informal networks:** Officers learn from each other, not just training
- **Participation:** Officers involved in policy development are more likely to follow it

**Modern Application:** Community policing emphasizes officer discretion and relationship-building

---

## Modern Organizational Theories

### "It Depends" Approach

**Systems Theory:** Organizations are interconnected parts

- *Example: Changes in arrest policies affect courts, jails, probation*

**Contingency Theory:** Best approach depends on the situation

- *Example: Military structure for SWAT, team structure for community policing*

**Network Theory:** Organizations work through partnerships

- *Example: Criminal justice involves police, courts, corrections, social services*

---

## Organizational Structure Types

### Different Ways to Organize

**Hierarchical:** Traditional pyramid

- *Example: Traditional police department*

**Matrix:** People report to multiple supervisors

- *Example: Detective assigned to both robbery unit and gang task force*

**Flat:** Few management levels

- *Example: Small-town police with chief and officers*

**Network:** Loose connections between independent units

- *Example: Multi-agency drug task force*

---

## Which Structure When?

**Hierarchical works for:**

- Routine, predictable work
- Clear authority needed
- Large organizations

**Flat works for:**

- Creative, flexible work  
- Quick decision-making
- Small organizations

**Matrix works for:**

- Complex projects
- Multiple expertise needed
- Temporary assignments

**Your challenge:** Most public organizations need elements of all three

---

## Organizational Culture

### "How We Do Things Around Here"

**Culture includes:**

- **Values:** What's important (service, integrity, efficiency)
- **Norms:** Unwritten rules of behavior
- **Symbols:** Uniforms, badges, ceremonies
- **Stories:** Legends about heroes and villains
- **Rituals:** Regular practices and traditions

**Culture often matters more than formal rules**

---

## Culture in Criminal Justice

**Police Culture Examples:**

- "Thin blue line" solidarity
- "Officer safety first" priority
- "We protect and serve" mission
- Shift briefings, roll call traditions
- Stories about legendary officers

**Court Culture Examples:**

- "Justice is blind" ideal
- Formal courtroom procedures
- Professional dress and language
- Traditions and ceremonies

**Question:** How does culture help or hinder organizational goals?

---

## Leadership in Public Organizations

### Different Styles for Different Situations

**Autocratic Leadership:** Clear direction, top-down control

- *Good for: Crisis situations, dangerous operations*
- *Example: SWAT team leader during active incident*

**Democratic Leadership:** Participative decision-making

- *Good for: Complex problems, building buy-in*
- *Example: Community policing planning meetings*

**Laissez-faire Leadership:** Hands-off, delegate authority

- *Good for: Highly skilled professionals*
- *Example: Supervising experienced detectives*

---

## Modern Leadership Concepts

**Transformational Leadership:** Inspiring people toward shared vision

- *Example: Police chief leading department culture change*

**Servant Leadership:** Focus on developing and serving followers

- *Example: Court administrator supporting judges and staff*

**Authentic Leadership:** Leading with integrity and self-awareness

- *Example: Sheriff being honest about budget constraints*

**Question:** Which style would work best for leading organizational change?

---

## Decision Making in Organizations

### How Choices Get Made

**Rational Model:** Identify problem → Generate options → Evaluate → Choose best

- *Works when: Clear goals, complete information, unlimited time*

**Bounded Rationality:** Choose first "good enough" option

- *Works when: Limited time, incomplete information, competing pressures*

**Incremental Model:** Make small changes to existing policies

- *Works when: High uncertainty, political constraints*

---

## Decision Making Examples

**Police Chief Budget Decision:**

- **Rational:** Analyze all options, cost-benefit analysis
- **Bounded Rational:** Choose first option that meets basic needs
- **Incremental:** Adjust last year's budget slightly

**Reality:** Most public sector decisions involve bounded rationality or incrementalism

**Why?** Political pressures, limited information, time constraints, multiple stakeholders

---

## Contemporary Challenges

### What Modern Public Organizations Face

**Complexity:** Multiple missions, stakeholders, accountability systems
**Technology:** Rapid change, digital transformation, cybersecurity
**Networks:** Working across boundaries, partnerships, collaboration  
**Transparency:** Social media, open records, 24/7 scrutiny
**Diversity:** Multicultural workforce and communities
**Resources:** Doing more with less, competing priorities

---

## Organizational Change
