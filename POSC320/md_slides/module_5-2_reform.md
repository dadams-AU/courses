## Opening Reality Check

**"The government that governs least, governs best" vs. "We need government to solve our problems"**

**American paradox:** We simultaneously want:

- Smaller, more efficient government
- More services and better performance  
- Lower taxes and higher quality
- Less bureaucracy and more accountability

**Today's focus:** How reform movements try to resolve these contradictions

---

## Why Administrative Reform Matters

### It's Not Just Academic Theory

**Reform movements shape your future workplace:**

- How police departments organize and operate
- What technologies courts use to manage cases
- How corrections systems approach rehabilitation
- How agencies measure and report performance

**Current examples:** Police reform, court modernization, criminal justice system overhauls

**Your role:** You'll be both implementing existing reforms and designing new ones

---

## America's Reform DNA

### Why We Never Stop Reforming

**Revolutionary Origins:** Born from dissatisfaction with existing government
**Federalism:** 50 states as "laboratories of democracy"
**Democratic Values:** Regular elections create pressure for change
**Business Culture:** "If it works in private sector, why not government?"
**Crisis-Driven:** Major problems trigger reform movements

**Result:** Continuous cycle of reform, counter-reform, and new reform

---

## Historical Pattern of Reform Waves

### The Cycle Repeats

**Progressive Era (1900s-1920s):**

- Professional civil service, merit hiring
- Scientific management principles

**New Deal (1930s-1940s):**

- Expanded federal role, new agencies
- Administrative coordination and planning

**Great Society (1960s):**

- Social programs, community participation
- Representative bureaucracy

**Reinventing Government (1980s-2000s):**

- Market-based reforms, privatization
- Performance measurement, customer service

---

## Three Major Types of Reform

### Different Approaches to "Fixing" Government

**1. Downsizing:** Make government smaller and cheaper
**2. Reinventing/Reengineering:** Make government work like business
**3. Continuous Improvement:** Make government work better

**Key insight:** These often conflict with each other

- Downsizing vs. better service
- Business efficiency vs. democratic accountability
- Continuous improvement vs. revolutionary change

---

## Reform Type 1: Downsizing Government

### "Government is Too Big and Costs Too Much"

**Core Philosophy:**

- Private sector more efficient than public
- Government crowds out private initiative
- Taxpayers are customers being overcharged
- Smaller government = better government

**Famous Examples:**

- **Proposition 13 (California, 1978):** Property tax limits
- **Taxpayer Bill of Rights (Colorado):** Revenue limits
- **Reagan Era (1980s):** Federal workforce reduction

---

## Downsizing in Criminal Justice

### Real-World Applications

**Police Departments:**

- Privatizing some security functions
- Civilian employees for non-enforcement roles
- Reducing administrative overhead
- Consolidating small departments

**Courts:**

- Electronic filing to reduce staff needs
- Automated case processing systems
- Private mediation and arbitration services
- Shared services across jurisdictions

**Corrections:**

- Private prison contracts
- Electronic monitoring vs. incarceration
- Community-based alternatives
- Reduced supervision caseloads

---

## Downsizing: Benefits and Problems

### What Works and What Doesn't

**Potential Benefits:**

- Lower costs and taxes
- Reduced bureaucracy and red tape
- More flexible operations
- Competition-driven efficiency

**Common Problems:**

- Service quality may decline
- Democratic accountability weakened
- Job losses and morale problems
- False savings (costs shift elsewhere)

**Example:** Private prisons - cost savings vs. quality concerns and democratic oversight issues

---

## Reform Type 2: Reinventing Government

### "Government Should Work Like Business"

**Osborne & Gaebler's Principles (1992):**

- Government should steer, not row
- Empower communities and families
- Inject competition into service delivery
- Be driven by mission, not rules
- Focus on results, not inputs
- Meet customer needs, not bureaucracy
- Earn rather than spend
- Prevent rather than cure
- Decentralize authority
- Solve problems through market mechanisms

---

## Reinventing Government: Clinton Era

### National Performance Review (1993-2001)

**Goals:**

- Cut 252,000 federal jobs
- Save $108 billion over 5 years
- Reduce red tape and regulations
- Improve customer service

**Methods:**

- Employee empowerment initiatives
- One-stop service centers
- Performance measurement systems
- Customer satisfaction surveys

**Results:** Mixed success - some savings and improvements, but also unintended consequences

---

## Reinventing in Criminal Justice

### Business-Style Reforms

**Police Departments:**

- **Community policing:** Police as service providers
- **CompStat:** Data-driven performance management
- **Customer service:** Citizen satisfaction surveys
- **Decentralization:** Neighborhood-based policing

**Courts:**

- **Case management:** Business process improvement
- **Performance metrics:** Time to disposition, case backlogs
- **Customer focus:** User-friendly procedures and facilities
- **Technology:** Electronic filing, online services

**Corrections:**

- **Performance contracts:** Outcomes-based payments
- **Recidivism reduction:** Results-oriented programming
- **Cost-effectiveness:** Per-inmate cost comparisons

---

## Reform Type 3: Reengineering

### "Blow Up the Old System and Start Over"

**Core Concept:** Fundamental redesign of work processes

- Don't automate existing processes - redesign them
- Focus on outcomes, not activities
- Eliminate non-value-added steps
- Use technology to enable new ways of working

**Famous Example:** Passport processing - from 6 weeks to 10 days by completely redesigning the process

---

## Reengineering in Practice

### Criminal Justice Examples

**Court Case Processing:**

- **Before:** Paper files, multiple manual handoffs, sequential processing
- **After:** Electronic records, parallel processing, automated workflow

**Police Records Management:**

- **Before:** Paper reports, manual filing, limited search capability
- **After:** Digital reports, integrated databases, instant information sharing

**Corrections Intake:**

- **Before:** Multiple interviews, paper forms, manual classification
- **After:** Single interview, electronic records, automated risk assessment

**Challenge:** Reengineering often meets resistance from employees used to old ways

---

## Reform Type 4: Continuous Improvement

### "Small Changes Add Up to Big Results"

**Philosophy:**

- Employees closest to work know how to improve it
- Small, incremental changes are sustainable
- Quality improvement never ends
- Focus on processes, not just outcomes

**Tools:**

- Total Quality Management (TQM)
- Six Sigma methodology
- Plan-Do-Check-Act cycles
- Employee suggestion programs

---

## Continuous Improvement Examples

### Criminal Justice Applications

**Police Departments:**

- **SARA Model:** Scanning, Analysis, Response, Assessment for problem-solving
- **After-action reviews:** Learning from critical incidents
- **Community feedback:** Regular input on police performance
- **Officer suggestions:** Front-line input on policy improvements

**Courts:**

- **Case flow management:** Reducing delays through process improvements
- **Customer feedback:** User satisfaction with court services
- **Technology upgrades:** Incremental system improvements
- **Training programs:** Continuous staff development

---
