## Opening Scenario

**You're the Police Chief. It's 2 AM and you get these calls:**

- Active shooter at a downtown nightclub
- Multi-car accident with injuries on the interstate
- Domestic violence call in progress
- Burglary alarm at a jewelry store

**You have 12 patrol officers on duty citywide.**

**Questions:** How do you decide who goes where? What information do you need? How quickly must you decide? Who's responsible if things go wrong?

**Today's focus:** Understanding how public administrators make decisions under pressure, uncertainty, and competing demands

---

## Why Decision-Making Matters in Public Administration

### The Stakes Are Higher

**Public decisions affect:**

- Individual rights and freedoms
- Community safety and well-being
- Public trust and legitimacy
- Resource allocation and fairness
- Legal compliance and accountability

**Criminal Justice Examples:**

- **Prosecutorial decisions:** Who to charge, what charges to file
- **Police deployment:** Where to patrol, what strategies to use
- **Corrections policies:** Treatment vs. punishment emphasis
- **Court administration:** Case scheduling, resource allocation

**Key difference:** Public decisions must serve the public interest, not just efficiency

---

## The Information Challenge: "Fake News" and Decision-Making

### Making Good Decisions with Bad Information

**Information Problems in Criminal Justice:**

- **Conflicting witness accounts:** Different versions of events
- **Media pressure:** Sensationalized reporting affecting decisions
- **Social media rumors:** False information spreading rapidly
- **Political pressure:** Demands for action based on incomplete information
- **Data limitations:** Statistics that don't tell the whole story

**Example:** High-profile police incident

- Multiple videos from different angles
- Conflicting eyewitness statements
- Social media speculation and rumors
- Political pressure for immediate response
- Legal constraints on information release

**Challenge:** How do administrators make sound decisions amid information chaos?

---

## Strategies for Better Information

### Tools for Cutting Through the Noise

**Source Verification:**

- Multiple independent sources
- Official reports vs. social media
- Expert analysis and professional judgment
- Historical context and patterns

**Information Systems:**

- Real-time data from multiple agencies
- Crime analysis and pattern recognition
- Performance metrics and trend analysis
- Evidence-based research and best practices

**Stakeholder Input:**

- Community feedback and concerns
- Professional expertise from staff
- Legal counsel and compliance review
- Coordination with other agencies

---

## Four Models of Decision-Making

### Different Ways to Make Choices

1. **Rational Model:** Comprehensive analysis and optimization
2. **Bounded Rationality:** "Good enough" solutions with limited information
3. **Incremental Model:** Small changes to existing policies
4. **Garbage Can Model:** Solutions looking for problems in chaotic environments

**Reality:** Public administrators use all four depending on the situation

---

## Model 1: Rational Decision-Making

### The "Textbook" Approach

**Steps in Rational Decision-Making:**

1. **Define the problem** clearly and completely
2. **Identify all alternatives** and possible solutions
3. **Evaluate each option** using consistent criteria
4. **Select the best alternative** based on analysis
5. **Implement the decision** systematically
6. **Monitor and evaluate** results for future learning

**When It Works:** Complex policy decisions with adequate time and resources

**Criminal Justice Example:** Developing a new community policing strategy with research, community input, pilot testing, and evaluation

---

## Rational Model: Strengths and Limitations

### Why Pure Rationality Is Rare

**Strengths:**

- Thorough analysis and consideration
- Defensible, evidence-based decisions
- Clear documentation and accountability
- Optimizes outcomes when properly applied

**Limitations:**

- **Time constraints:** Emergencies don't wait for analysis
- **Information gaps:** Perfect information rarely available
- **Resource limits:** Comprehensive analysis is expensive
- **Political pressure:** Stakeholders want quick action
- **Value conflicts:** Different groups define "best" differently

**Reality:** Most public decisions involve bounded rationality

---

## Model 2: Bounded Rationality

### "Satisficing" Instead of Optimizing

**Herbert Simon's Concept:**

- Decision-makers have limited time, information, and cognitive capacity
- Look for "good enough" solutions rather than perfect ones
- Use experience, rules of thumb, and professional judgment
- Accept first acceptable solution rather than continuing to search

**Criminal Justice Applications:**

- **Emergency response:** Quick deployment decisions with limited information
- **Daily operations:** Routine decisions based on standard procedures
- **Resource allocation:** Distributing patrol officers based on experience and patterns

---

## Bounded Rationality in Action

### Real-World Example: Police Deployment

**Situation:** Friday night, limited patrol coverage

**Rational approach would require:**

- Analysis of all crime patterns and predictions
- Evaluation of every possible deployment option
- Optimization algorithm for best coverage
- Real-time adjustment based on changing conditions

**Bounded rational approach:**

- Use established beat assignments and hot spot knowledge
- Adjust based on recent crime trends and events
- Apply professional experience and judgment
- Make quick decisions as situations develop

**Result:** Good enough decisions made quickly with available information

---

## Model 3: Incremental Decision-Making

### "Muddling Through" with Small Changes

**Charles Lindblom's Approach:**

- Make small adjustments to existing policies
- Test changes on limited scale before full implementation
- Build consensus through gradual change
- Reduce risk by avoiding dramatic policy shifts

**When It Works:**

- Politically sensitive issues requiring consensus
- Complex problems without clear solutions
- Situations where radical change is risky or impossible

**Criminal Justice Example:** Police reform through gradual policy changes rather than complete department restructuring

---

## Incremental Model: Benefits and Drawbacks

### The Politics of Small Steps

**Benefits:**

- **Politically feasible:** Easier to build consensus for small changes
- **Risk reduction:** Limited exposure from policy failures
- **Learning opportunity:** Test and adjust based on experience
- **Resource efficiency:** Lower costs than comprehensive reform

**Drawbacks:**

- **Slow progress:** May not address urgent problems quickly enough
- **Status quo bias:** Difficult to make necessary major changes
- **Crisis vulnerability:** Incremental change may not prevent major problems
- **Inequality maintenance:** Small changes may preserve existing inequities

**Example:** Gradual police training improvements vs. comprehensive reform demands

---

## Model 4: Garbage Can Decision-Making

### When Organizations Are in Chaos

**Cohen, March, and Olsen's Model:**

- **Problems** seeking solutions
- **Solutions** looking for problems to solve
- **Participants** moving in and out of decision processes
- **Choice opportunities** arising unpredictably

**When It Happens:**

- Crisis situations with multiple urgent issues
- Organizations under pressure with competing priorities
- High turnover and unclear authority
- Media attention and political pressure

**Criminal Justice Example:** Major incident response where multiple agencies, problems, and solutions collide in unpredictable ways

---

## Garbage Can in Crisis Situations

### Example: Major Public Safety Crisis

**Multiple Problems:**

- Immediate public safety threat
- Media and political pressure
- Resource coordination challenges
- Legal and procedural requirements

**Multiple Solutions:**

- Deploy all available resources
- Call for mutual aid assistance
- Implement emergency protocols
- Hold press conference

**Multiple Participants:**

- Police commanders, elected officials
- Emergency management, media relations
- Community leaders, agency partners

**Result:** Solutions may be chosen based on who's in the room and what's available, not optimal analysis

---

## Public Choice Theory

### Applying Economic Logic to Government Decisions

**Core Assumptions:**

- Public employees are self-interested, rational actors
- Agencies seek to maximize budgets and influence
- Politicians seek to maximize votes and power
- Citizens seek to maximize benefits while minimizing costs

**Applications to Criminal Justice:**

- **Police departments:** Seeking larger budgets and expanded authority
- **Prosecutors:** Pursuing high-profile cases for career advancement
- **Corrections:** Empire-building through expanded facilities and programs

**Insight:** Understanding self-interest helps predict organizational behavior

---

## Public Choice: Insights and Limitations

### When Market Logic Applies to Government

**Useful Insights:**

- Explains why agencies resist budget cuts
- Predicts resistance to efficiency improvements
- Shows why coordination between agencies is difficult
- Reveals incentive misalignments in bureaucracy

**Limitations:**

- **Oversimplifies motivation:** Many public employees are mission-driven
- **Ignores professional norms:** Training and ethics matter
- **Misses collaborative success stories:** Agencies do work together
- **Cynical assumptions:** May become self-fulfilling prophecy

**Balance:** Recognize self-interest while promoting public service values

---

## Bargaining and Participative Decision-Making

### Involving Stakeholders in Decisions

**Why Involve Others:**

- **Better information:** Different perspectives reveal blind spots
- **Improved quality:** More ideas lead to better solutions
- **Increased legitimacy:** Stakeholder involvement builds support
- **Democratic values:** Citizens should influence decisions affecting them

**Criminal Justice Applications:**

- **Community policing councils:** Citizen input on police priorities
- **Sentencing circles:** Restorative justice involving victims and community
- **Task forces:** Multi-agency collaboration on complex problems
- **Public hearings:** Community input on policy changes

---

## Participative Decision-Making: Benefits and Challenges

### When More Voices Help (and Hurt)

**Benefits:**

- **Better decisions:** More information and perspectives
- **Stronger support:** Stakeholders more likely to support decisions they helped make
- **Democratic legitimacy:** Public participation in public decisions
- **Learning opportunity:** Education for both administrators and citizens

**Challenges:**

- **Time consuming:** Consultation takes longer than unilateral decisions
- **Conflicting interests:** Different groups want different things
- **Technical complexity:** Citizens may lack expertise for complex decisions
- **Accountability confusion:** Who's responsible when many are involved?

---

## Risk Management in Public Decisions

### Dealing with Uncertainty and Consequences

**Types of Risk in Criminal Justice:**

- **Public safety risks:** Officer safety, community protection
- **Legal risks:** Constitutional violations, liability exposure
- **Political risks:** Public backlash, electoral consequences
- **Financial risks:** Budget overruns, cost effectiveness
- **Operational risks:** Technology failures, coordination breakdowns

**Risk Assessment Tools:**

- Scenario planning and contingency preparation
- Historical data and trend analysis
- Expert consultation and professional judgment
- Stress testing and simulation exercises

---

## Risk Management Strategies

### How Public Administrators Handle Uncertainty

**Risk Avoidance:** Don't do risky things

- *Example: Avoiding controversial police tactics*

**Risk Mitigation:** Reduce likelihood or impact

- *Example: Training and equipment to reduce officer injuries*

**Risk Transfer:** Shift risk to others

- *Example: Insurance policies, contracted services*

**Risk Acceptance:** Acknowledge and monitor

- *Example: Accepting some level of crime as inevitable*

**Challenge:** Balancing risk aversion with mission accomplishment

---

## Information and Values in Decision-Making

### Facts vs. Values in Public Decisions

**The Fact-Value Problem:**

- **Facts:** What is the situation? What are the options? What are likely outcomes?
- **Values:** What should we prioritize? What's most important? What's right?
- **Reality:** Most decisions involve both factual analysis and value judgments

**Criminal Justice Example: Police Use of Force Policy**

- **Facts:** Officer safety statistics, community complaint data, legal requirements
- **Values:** Community safety vs. individual rights, officer discretion vs. accountability
- **Decision:** Policy must reflect both factual analysis and community values

---

## Balancing Professional Judgment and Democratic Accountability

### The Expertise vs. Democracy Tension

**Professional Expertise:**

- Technical knowledge and specialized training
- Experience with similar situations
- Understanding of best practices and research
- Legal and procedural requirements

**Democratic Accountability:**

- Elected officials represent community preferences
- Citizens should influence decisions affecting them
- Transparency and public input requirements
- Political responsiveness and electoral consequences

**The Challenge:** When professional judgment conflicts with democratic preferences

---

## Case Study: Community Policing Implementation
