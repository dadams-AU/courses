## Opening Budget Crisis

**You're the City Manager. The Mayor walks into your office:**

*"We have a problem. The city council wants to hire 20 new police officers after last month's crime spike. The community wants more social services and mental health programs. The fire department needs new equipment. The courts are backed up and need more staff. And our revenue is down 15% from last year."*

**Questions:**

- How do you decide what gets funded and what doesn't?
- Who should make these choices?
- How do you balance competing demands with limited resources?

**Today's reality:** Budgeting is where policy meets politics meets practicality

## What Is Public Budgeting Really About?

### More Than Just Numbers

**A budget is:**

- **A plan:** How we'll use resources to achieve goals
- **A policy statement:** What government will and won't do
- **A political document:** Who gets what, when, and how
- **A control mechanism:** How we manage and monitor spending
- **A reflection of values:** What society prioritizes

**Bottom line:** Budgets are the most important policy documents government produces - they determine what actually happens

## Why Budgeting Matters to You

### Your Future Career Impact

**As a future public administrator, budgets will:**

- **Determine your job:** Whether positions exist and get funded
- **Shape your work:** What programs and services you can provide
- **Limit your options:** Resource constraints affect everything you do
- **Measure your success:** Performance often judged by budget efficiency
- **Reflect your values:** How you allocate resources shows priorities

**Criminal Justice Reality:** Public safety is expensive - police, courts, and corrections consume 10-15% of most government budgets

## The Budget Process: How It Really Works

### From Planning to Spending

**1. Budget Preparation (6-12 months before fiscal year):**

- Agencies submit budget requests
- Executives review and modify requests
- Public hearings and stakeholder input

**2. Budget Adoption (before fiscal year starts):**

- Legislative review and modification
- Committee hearings and floor debates
- Final passage and executive signature

**3. Budget Execution (during fiscal year):**

- Agencies spend according to approved budgets
- Monthly and quarterly monitoring
- Adjustments for changing circumstances

**4. Budget Evaluation (after fiscal year ends):**

- Financial audits and performance reviews
- Lessons learned for next budget cycle

## Criminal Justice Budget Calendar

### When Things Happen

**January-March:** Crime analysis, performance review, needs assessment
**April-June:** Department budget requests, equipment planning
**July-September:** Executive budget preparation, community input
**October-December:** Legislative review, public hearings, final approval

**Ongoing Throughout Year:**

- Grant applications and awards
- Emergency budget adjustments
- Quarterly performance reviews
- Overtime monitoring and management

**Challenge:** Crime doesn't follow budget calendars - emergencies require flexible response

- Emphasizes results and accountability
- Requires good performance measurement

**Program Budgeting:**

- Organizes by programs or functions
- Shows total cost of achieving objectives
- Facilitates comparison across programs

**Zero-Based Budgeting:**

- Starts from zero each year
- Justifies every expenditure
- Time-consuming but thorough

---

## Line-Item Budget Example: Police Department

### Traditional Approach

**Personnel:**

- Police Chief: $120,000
- Lieutenants (3): $270,000
- Sergeants (8): $520,000
- Patrol Officers (45): $2,475,000
- Administrative Staff (6): $240,000

**Equipment:**

- Patrol Vehicles (12): $360,000
