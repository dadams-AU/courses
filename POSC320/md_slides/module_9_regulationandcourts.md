## Opening Scenario: The Rules That Rule You

**Consider a typical day in criminal justice:**

- Police officer uses equipment approved by federal safety regulations
- Prosecutor follows rules set by state bar association
- Court clerk processes case using procedures mandated by state judiciary
- Corrections officer implements policies required by federal civil rights regulations

**Questions:**

- Who made all these rules?
- How were they created?
- What happens when someone disagrees with them?
- Who has the final say?

**Today's focus:** Understanding the vast regulatory system that governs public administration and how courts oversee it

## What Is Government Regulation?

### More Than Just Laws

**Regulation = Rules created by administrative agencies to implement laws**

**Why Regulations Exist:**

- **Legislative limits:** Congress/legislatures can't write detailed rules for every situation
- **Technical complexity:** Specialized expertise needed for complex issues
- **Changing conditions:** Rules need updating more frequently than laws
- **Administrative efficiency:** Faster than passing new legislation

**Criminal Justice Examples:**

- **Federal:** FBI background check procedures, DEA drug classification rules
- **State:** Police training standards, court administration procedures
- **Local:** Police use-of-force policies, jail operation requirements

---

## The Regulatory Landscape in Criminal Justice

### Who Regulates What

**Federal Regulation:**

- **Civil rights compliance:** Equal protection, due process requirements
- **Professional standards:** FBI training, federal court procedures
- **Safety regulations:** Equipment standards, workplace safety
- **Information systems:** Privacy rules, data sharing protocols

**State Regulation:**

- **Professional licensing:** Police officer certification, attorney licensing
- **Operational standards:** Jail conditions, court procedures
- **Training requirements:** Academy curricula, continuing education
- **Oversight mechanisms:** Internal affairs, disciplinary procedures

**Local Regulation:**

## The Constitutional Foundation

### Where Regulatory Power Comes From

**Constitutional Delegation:**

## The Regulatory Process: How Rules Are Made

### From Concept to Implementation

### The Regulatory Process: Step by Step

1. **Legislative Authorization**

- Congress or the state legislature grants rule-making authority to an agency.
- *Example: Authorizing a state agency to set police training standards.*

2. **Proposed Rule Development**

- The agency analyzes the problem and drafts a proposed rule.
- *Example: Developing new use-of-force training requirements.*

3. **Public Notice and Comment**

- The proposed rule is published for public and stakeholder input.
- *Example: Police departments and community groups provide feedback.*

4. **Final Rule Issuance**

- The agency reviews comments, revises as needed, and issues the final regulation.
- *Example: Adopting revised training standards with an implementation timeline.*

5. **Implementation and Enforcement**

- Agencies monitor compliance and enforce the new requirements.
- *Example: Conducting inspections and certification processes.*
