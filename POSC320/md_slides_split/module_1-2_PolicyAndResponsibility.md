### Policy Execution vs. Policy Making

#### Policy Execution

- Public administration is concerned with the implementation of public policy.
- Policy execution is the process of translating public policy into action.
  - Expanding some individuals' opportunities by extending governmental services and protections to them.
  - Regulating the behavior of individuals and organizations.
  - Redistributing resources from some individuals to others.
  - Protecting the public from harm.

#### Policy Making

- Public administrators help decision makers make policy in two stages:
  - Policy formulation: identifying problems and developing solutions.
  - Policy implementation: translating policy into action.

### Administrative Responsibility

- Public administrators are responsible for the effective and efficient implementation of public policy.
- Complex and confining system of accountability:
  - Statutes and regulations limit administrators' discretion.
  - Legislative oversight committees monitor administrators' actions.
  - Budgetary oversight committees control administrators' resources.

### Administrative Responsibility

- Commitments that shape administrative responsibility:
  - Complex web of government and a legitimate role for other parts of government, including those with legal control over administrative behavior
  - Loyalty to agency and to the programs they carry out
  - Professional civil service standards and desire to be recognized by fellow professionals outside government


---

### Accountability

- Accountability is the obligation to explain and justify actions to some higher authority.
- Fundamental problem:
  - External controls lead to rules, standardized procedures, and red tape.
  - Internal controls can replace external oversight, but that requires trust between administrators and elected officials.
