## Classical School: Six PA Principles

1. Bases of Organization: structural strategies relate to purpose, process, clientele, and place.

3. Focus on purpose at the top: problem solving through organizing at the executive level by purpose and bringing together the activities that contribute to that purpose.
4. Span of control: the number of subordinates a manager can effectively supervise.
5. Unity of command: each employee should have only one supervisor.
6. Separate line and staff: line managers are responsible for achieving organizational goals; staff managers provide advice and support.
