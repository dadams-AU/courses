  <li>
    <p>Who Cares? <strong>Stakeholders:</strong> Taxpayers, Program Beneficiaries, Program Administrators, Elected Officials, etc.</p>

<h2 id="public-policy-definitions">Public Policy: Definitions</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Heclo</strong> (1975, 305): Policymaking can be viewed as “collective puzzlement on society’s behalf; it entails both deciding and knowing.”</li>
</ul>

<p>–</p>

<h2 id="public-policy-definitions-1">Public Policy: Definitions</h2>

<p><em>“A definition of the problem is part of the problem: Politics arises because we do not share perceptions of what the problems are, or if we do, what follows from the definition in terms of what can be or should be done… Ill-structured as they are, public issues are not demarcated: we do not know where one problem begins, and another ends”</em> (Parsons 1995, 88-9).</p>

<h2 id="public-policy-in-a-democracy">Public Policy in a Democracy</h2>

<p><strong>James A. Jones</strong> (1974, 561): “Whosoever initially identifies a social problem shapes the initial terms in which it will be debated and the initial range of alternatives that will be considered. The initial identification of a social problem is thus a crucial act of social policy.”</p>
