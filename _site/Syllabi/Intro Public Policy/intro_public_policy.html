<p>Federal domestic policy making. Structure, functions and relationships among American national institutions, including executive, legislative and judicial branches, media, political parties and pressure groups.</p>

<h1 id="course-description">Course Description</h1>

<p>In this course, students will explore and engage in thoughtful discussions on the processes and key players involved in creating public policy in the United States. The curriculum focuses on the structure, functions, and relationships among American national institutions, including the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government, the media, political parties, and interest groups. We will examine the various official and unofficial influences on the policy process and the limitations imposed by institutional and structural factors.</p>

<p>This course delves into the historical and constitutional development of the policy process, as well as the distinct characteristics of public policy within a federal system. By understanding policy-making in the context of a constitutional republic and a federalized governance system, students will gain a deeper appreciation for the complexities and uncertainties surrounding agenda setting, policy making, policy implementation, and policy evaluation in the American political system.</p>

<h1 id="student-learning-objectives">Student Learning Objectives</h1>
