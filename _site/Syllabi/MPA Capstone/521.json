  {"id":"Butz2022","abstract":"This research adds to the emergent literature on intersectionality and public administration through examining how transgender women of color (trans WOC) are interacting with U.S. social welfare offices. It is our contention that trans WOC, facing a compounded set of negative stereotypes derived from racial and gender identities, will be more likely than other transgender identifying persons to: (1) avoid seeking out public welfare benefits and (2) be more likely to report experiencing discriminatory treatment in social welfare offices. Using data from the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey we uncover evidence that trans WOC are more likely to avoid social welfare offices and face discrimination in social welfare offices. Scholars and administrators of social welfare programs, including Social Security related benefits, should be aware of the potential for public benefit avoidance and administrative discrimination directed toward historically marginalized groups and prioritize social equity considerations among clients facing compounded intersectional barriers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Butz","given":"Adam M."},{"family":"Gaynor","given":"Tia Sherèe"}],"citation-key":"Butz2022","container-title":"Public Administration Review","DOI":"10.1111/puar.13468","ISSN":"1540-6210","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"en","page":"433-445","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Intersectionality and Social Welfare: Avoidance and Unequal Treatment among Transgender Women of Color","title-short":"Intersectionality and Social Welfare","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/puar.13468","volume":"82"},

  {"id":"jung2022","abstract":"Inclusion in the workplace is defined as the extent to which individuals perceive that they are part of significant processes in organizations. This article explores the determinants of workplace inclusion by asking: How does the demographic composition of social networks inside and outside of the workplace affect perceived inclusion in the workplace? We apply literature on social identity theory and social network theory to develop and test hypotheses on professional sub-network demographic composition using the linear regression analysis on data from the 2011 National Science Foundation–funded national survey of academic faculty on work environment and careers in US universities. Among other results, we find that perceived inclusion is explained by the interactions between race, gender, and demographic composition of professional networks. Findings provide new insights for the management of diversity in the workplace.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Jung","given":"Heyjie"},{"family":"Welch","given":"Eric W."}],"citation-key":"jung2022","container-title":"Public Administration Review","DOI":"10.1111/puar.13470","ISSN":"1540-6210","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"en","page":"522-536","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Impact of Demographic Composition of Social Networks on Perceived Inclusion in the Workplace","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/puar.13470","volume":"82"},

  {"id":"zavattaro2022","abstract":"Contemporarily, the word “woke” has moved into the popular lexicon, largely to mean aware of and ideally doing something about systemic racism. After the George Floyd murder, and many other state-sanctioned murders of Black Americans, protests erupted globally, and public administrators responded either with actionable policy changes or sometimes symbolic, “woke” statements that did little to alter the system. In this conceptual paper, we explore the reasons for this via Baudrillard's phases of the image, showing how the word “woke” has moved from roots in the Black community to being weaponized today via its disconnection from this reality, thus trending toward its own hyperreality. In this final phase, the word “woke” has no connection to its former reality, leading to the passage of legislation that upholds White power structures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Zavattaro","given":"Staci M."},{"family":"Bearfield","given":"Domonic"}],"citation-key":"zavattaro2022","container-title":"Public Administration Review","DOI":"10.1111/puar.13484","ISSN":"1540-6210","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"en","page":"585-593","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Weaponization of Wokeness: The Theater of Management and Implications for Public Administration","title-short":"Weaponization of Wokeness","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/puar.13484","volume":"82"}
